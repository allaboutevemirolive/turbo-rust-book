What is Modularity in Rust?

In Rust, modularity refers to the ability to organize code into reusable and independent modules. Modules allow you to group related code together, encapsulate functionality, and create clear boundaries between different parts of your program. Modularity is an important aspect of Rust's design philosophy, as it promotes code organization, separation of concerns, and code reuse.

Modules in Rust are defined using the `mod` keyword. You can create a module by placing code inside a block following the `mod` keyword, like this:

```rust
mod my_module {
    // Code for the module goes here
}
```

By default, the code inside a module is private to that module, meaning it can only be accessed from within the same module. However, you can use the `pub` keyword to make specific items (functions, structs, enums, etc.) public and accessible from outside the module.

Modules can be organized hierarchically, forming a module tree. You can define nested modules within other modules to create a clear hierarchy and logical structure for your code. This allows you to manage the visibility and accessibility of code elements within the module tree.

Rust also provides the concept of crates, which are collections of modules that can be shared and reused as libraries. Crates enable code reuse across projects and provide a way to distribute Rust code to others. By using the `use` keyword, you can bring modules and items from other crates into your code, making them accessible for use.

Overall, modularity in Rust helps in building maintainable and scalable programs by organizing code into reusable and encapsulated units. It promotes separation of concerns, facilitates code reuse, and enables clear boundaries between different parts of your codebase.
