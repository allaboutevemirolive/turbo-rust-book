What is TDD process in Rust?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. The goal of TDD is to improve code quality, promote better design, and provide a safety net for making changes to the codebase. While TDD is not specific to any programming language, it can be applied to Rust development as well.

The TDD process typically follows these steps:

1. **Write a test**: In TDD, you start by writing a test that defines the desired behavior of a specific piece of functionality. This test is expected to fail initially because the corresponding code implementation does not exist.

2. **Run the test**: Execute the test suite and ensure that the new test fails, indicating that the desired behavior is not yet implemented.

3. **Write the minimum code**: Implement the minimal code necessary to make the test pass. The emphasis here is on creating a simple solution that fulfills the requirements of the test.

4. **Run all tests**: Run the entire test suite, including the newly created test. All tests should pass at this point, verifying that the new code implementation satisfies the desired behavior.

5. **Refactor**: After the test passes, you can refactor the code to improve its design, readability, and maintainability. The key is to ensure that all tests still pass after each refactoring step.

6. **Repeat**: Repeat the process by writing the next test for the next desired functionality, following the same steps until all desired features have been implemented.

When applying TDD to Rust development, you can use testing frameworks such as `rust-test`, `rustc`, or popular third-party libraries like `rust-test` or `tokio-test` to write and execute tests. These frameworks provide the necessary tools to define test cases, assertions, and test suites for your Rust code.

By following the TDD process in Rust, you can create a robust test suite that validates the correctness of your code and helps catch bugs early on. This approach can lead to more maintainable, modular, and reliable Rust applications.
