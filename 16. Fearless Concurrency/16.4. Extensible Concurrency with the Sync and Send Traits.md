## Extensible Concurrency with the Sync and Send Traits

Interestingly, the Rust language has very few concurrency features.

Almost every concurrency feature weâ€™ve talked about so far in this chapter has been part of the standard library, not the language.

Your options for handling concurrency are not limited to the language or the standard library; you can write your own concurrency features or use those written by others.


However, two concurrency concepts are embedded in the language: the `std::marker` traits `Sync` and `Send`.
