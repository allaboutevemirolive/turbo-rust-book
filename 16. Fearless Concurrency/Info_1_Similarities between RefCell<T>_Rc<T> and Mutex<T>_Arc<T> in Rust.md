# More Similarities between RefCell<T>_Rc<T> and Mutex<T>_ARc<T> in Rust

Similarities between `RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` in Rust

___


`RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` are both smart pointers in Rust that allow for interior mutability and shared ownership, respectively.


`RefCell<T>` is a type that provides *interior mutability*, which allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data.

This is useful when you need to mutate data that is shared between multiple parts of your program.

`Rc<T>` is a type that provides shared ownership, which allows you to have multiple owners of the same data.


Similarly, `Mutex<T>` is a type that provides interior mutability and allows only one thread to access some data at any given time.

This is useful when you need to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

`ARc<T>` is a type that provides shared ownership and allows multiple threads to access the same data concurrently.



Both `RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` have similar use cases, but they differ in terms of thread safety.

`RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` are not thread-safe, while `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` are thread-safe.



## Important things to know about them

- `RefCell<T>` provides interior mutability, which allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data.

However, `RefCell<T>` is not thread-safe and should only be used in single-threaded scenarios.


- `Rc<T>` provides shared ownership, which allows you to have multiple owners of the same data.

However, `Rc<T>` is not thread-safe and should only be used in single-threaded scenarios.


- `Mutex<T>` provides interior mutability and allows only one thread to access some data at any given time.`Mutex<T>` is thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded scenarios.


- `ARc<T>` provides shared ownership and allows multiple threads to access the same data concurrently.

`ARc<T>` is thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded scenarios.


- When using `Mutex<T>` or `ARc<T>`, you need to acquire a lock before accessing the data.

This ensures that only one thread can access the data at a time.


- When using `RefCell<T>` or `Rc<T>`, you can mutate the data without acquiring a lock.

However, you need to ensure that there are no immutable references to the data at the same time.


- `RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` have similar use cases, but they differ in terms of thread safety.

`RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` are not thread-safe, while `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` are thread-safe.



In summary, `RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` and `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` are both smart pointers in Rust that allow for interior mutability and shared ownership, respectively.

They have similar use cases, but they differ in terms of thread safety.

`RefCell<T>`/`Rc<T>` are not thread-safe and should only be used in single-threaded scenarios, while `Mutex<T>`/`ARc<T>` are thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded scenarios.

When using `Mutex<T>` or `ARc<T>`, you need to acquire a lock before accessing the data, while when using `RefCell<T>` or `Rc<T>`, you can mutate the data without acquiring a lock.
