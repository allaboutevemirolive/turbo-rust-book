Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the 

- `median` (when sorted, the value in the middle position) and 
- `mode` (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) 

of the list.

Rust code that solves the given task using a vector, sorting, and a hash map:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    let median = calculate_median(&numbers);
    let mode = calculate_mode(&numbers);
    
    println!("Median: {}", median);
    println!("Mode: {}", mode);
}

fn calculate_median(numbers: &Vec<i32>) -> f64 {
    let mut sorted_numbers = numbers.clone();
    sorted_numbers.sort();

    let mid = sorted_numbers.len() / 2;

    if sorted_numbers.len() % 2 == 0 {
        (sorted_numbers[mid - 1] + sorted_numbers[mid]) as f64 / 2.0
    } else {
        sorted_numbers[mid] as f64
    }
}

fn calculate_mode(numbers: &Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let mut counts = HashMap::new();

    for &num in numbers {
        let count = counts.entry(num).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }

    let mut mode = 0;
    let mut max_count = 0;

    for (&num, &count) in &counts {
        if count > max_count {
            mode = num;
            max_count = count;
        }
    }

    mode
}
```

This code first defines the `calculate_median` function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the median. It clones the input vector, sorts the cloned vector, and then calculates the median based on the sorted values.

The `calculate_mode` function takes a vector of integers and returns the mode. It uses a hash map (`HashMap`) to count the occurrences of each number in the input vector. It then finds the number with the highest count and returns it as the mode.

In the `main` function, a sample list of integers is created, and the `calculate_median` and `calculate_mode` functions are called to obtain the median and mode respectively. The results are then printed to the console.

Let's go through the code step by step and explain each part:

1. Importing Dependencies:
   ```rust
   use std::collections::HashMap;
   ```
   The code begins by importing the necessary dependencies. In this case, we import the `HashMap` data structure from the `std::collections` module, which allows us to use hash maps to count the occurrences of numbers.

2. Defining the `main` function:
   ```rust
   fn main() {
       // ...
   }
   ```
   The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program.

3. Defining the `calculate_median` function:
   ```rust
   fn calculate_median(numbers: &Vec<i32>) -> f64 {
       // ...
   }
   ```
   This function takes a reference to a vector of integers as input and returns the median as a floating-point number (`f64`).

4. Cloning and Sorting the Vector:
   ```rust
   let mut sorted_numbers = numbers.clone();
   sorted_numbers.sort();
   ```
   In order to calculate the median, we create a mutable clone of the input vector called `sorted_numbers`. This prevents modifying the original vector. We then sort the cloned vector in ascending order using the `sort` method.

5. Calculating the Median:
   ```rust
   let mid = sorted_numbers.len() / 2;

   if sorted_numbers.len() % 2 == 0 {
       (sorted_numbers[mid - 1] + sorted_numbers[mid]) as f64 / 2.0
   } else {
       sorted_numbers[mid] as f64
   }
   ```
   The median calculation depends on whether the number of elements in the sorted vector is even or odd. If it's even, we take the average of the two middle values (`sorted_numbers[mid - 1]` and `sorted_numbers[mid]`). If it's odd, we simply take the middle value (`sorted_numbers[mid]`). The result is then converted to a floating-point number (`f64`) before returning.

6. Defining the `calculate_mode` function:
   ```rust
   fn calculate_mode(numbers: &Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
       // ...
   }
   ```
   This function takes a reference to a vector of integers as input and returns the mode as an integer (`i32`).

7. Counting Occurrences using a Hash Map:
   ```rust
   let mut counts = HashMap::new();

   for &num in numbers {
       let count = counts.entry(num).or_insert(0);
       *count += 1;
   }
   ```
   We create a new empty hash map called `counts` to store the counts of each number. Then, for each number (`num`) in the input vector, we use the `entry` method of the hash map to either insert a new entry with a count of 0 or retrieve a mutable reference to the existing entry. We then increment the count by 1.

8. Finding the Mode:
   ```rust
   let mut mode = 0;
   let mut max_count = 0;

   for (&num, &count) in &counts {
       if count > max_count {
           mode = num;
           max_count = count;
       }
   }

   mode
   ```
   We initialize variables `mode` and `max_count` to keep track of the number with the highest count (`mode`) and its count (`max_count`). We then iterate over each entry in the `counts` hash map using a destructuring pattern `(&num, &count)`. If the current count is greater than the previous maximum count, we update `mode` and `max_count`. Finally, we return the mode.

9.

 Calling Functions and Printing Results:
   ```rust
   let numbers = vec![1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9];
   let median  = calculate_median(&numbers);
   let mode    = calculate_mode(&numbers);

   println!("Median: {}", median);
   println!("Mode: {}", mode);
   ```
   In the `main` function, a sample list of integers is created (`numbers`). Then, the `calculate_median` and `calculate_mode` functions are called, passing the reference to the `numbers` vector as arguments. The returned median and mode values are stored in the `median` and `mode` variables respectively. Finally, the results are printed to the console using `println!` macro.

That's a high-level explanation of the provided Rust code. It uses vectors, sorting, and hash maps to calculate the median and mode of a given list of integers.
