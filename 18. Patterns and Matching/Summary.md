# Summary

Rust’s patterns are very useful in distinguishing between different kinds of data.

When used in `match` expressions, Rust ensures your patterns cover every possible value, or your program won’t compile.

Patterns in `let` statements and function parameters make those constructs more useful, enabling the destructuring of values into smaller parts at the same time as assigning to variables.

We can create simple or complex patterns to suit our needs.


Next, for the penultimate chapter of the book, we’ll look at some advanced aspects of a variety of Rust’s features.
