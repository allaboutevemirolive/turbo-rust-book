# Why didn't fix pattern-shadowing problem but instead use match guard

Why didn't the rust designer fix the "pattern-shadowing problem" directly but instead use match guard to overcome this problem?

The Rust language designers did not directly "fix" the pattern-shadowing problem because it is not considered a bug or flaw in the language. Instead, they provided match guards as a language feature to give developers more control and flexibility when dealing with pattern matches.

Pattern shadowing itself is not necessarily a problem but rather a consequence of how pattern matching and variable scoping work in Rust. It is a deliberate language design choice that allows you to create new bindings within specific scopes, including match arms.

The introduction of match guards in Rust provides a solution for scenarios where you want to perform additional conditions or checks on a matched value. Match guards are expressions that can be added to match arms, allowing for more complex pattern matching conditions beyond just the pattern itself.

By using match guards, you can perform additional checks on the matched value and avoid the need for shadowing in many cases. This can help clarify the intent of the code and make it more readable.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of a match guard to overcome the pattern-shadowing problem:

```rust
fn main() {
    let value = Some(5);

    match value {
        Some(value) if value > 0 => {
            println!("Value in match arm: {}", value);
        }
        Some(_) => {
            println!("Value is zero");
        }
        None => {}
    }

    // No error: `value` is accessible here
    println!("Value outside match: {:?}", value);
}
```

In this code, a match guard (`if value > 0`) is added to the first match arm to check for an additional condition. The match guard allows you to perform the desired check without having to introduce shadowing. This way, you can maintain access to the outer `value` variable and avoid the potential confusion and issues caused by shadowing.

By providing match guards, the Rust language designers empower developers to write more expressive and concise code when dealing with pattern matching, while still preserving the intentional behavior of pattern shadowing. The use of match guards helps address specific scenarios where additional conditions or checks are necessary within a pattern match.
