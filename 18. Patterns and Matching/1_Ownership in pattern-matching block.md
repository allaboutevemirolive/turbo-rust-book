# Ownership in pattern-matching block

1. Does the pattern-matching block also enforce ownership? 

Meaning the tuple moves into the pattern-matching block. 

2. After pattern-matching block, can I print the tuple outside the block again?

3. Why is the ownership of the tuple not transferred into the pattern-matching block? 

4. Give me examples of pattern-matching blocks that enforce ownership.

In most programming languages, including many functional programming languages, the pattern-matching block does not enforce ownership of the matched values. The ownership rules typically depend on the specific language and its memory management system.

Pattern matching is usually a non-destructive operation, meaning the matched values are not consumed or moved into the pattern-matching block. Instead, the pattern matching determines which branch of code should be executed based on the structure and values of the input. After the pattern-matching block, the original tuple or value remains intact and can be used further.

Here's an example in Rust, a systems programming language known for its ownership model, where pattern matching is used without transferring ownership:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tuple = (1, 2, 3);
    
    match tuple {
        (a, b, c) => {
            println!("Pattern matched: {}, {}, {}", a, b, c);
        }
    }
    
    println!("Tuple outside the block: {:?}", tuple);
}
```

In this example, the tuple is matched using a pattern in the `match` expression. The individual elements of the tuple are bound to variables `a`, `b`, and `c` inside the pattern-matching block. However, the ownership of the original tuple is not transferred or consumed. The tuple can still be accessed and printed outside the block.

It's worth noting that there may be certain cases or languages where pattern matching can enforce ownership. For example, in the Rust programming language, if the pattern includes a variable that takes ownership of a value, ownership can be transferred. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tuple = (1, 2, 3);
    
    match tuple {
        (a, b, c) => {
            println!("Pattern matched: {}, {}, {}", a, b, c);
            let _owned_tuple = tuple;  // Ownership of `tuple` is transferred
        }
    }
    
    // `tuple` is no longer accessible here
}
```

In this case, by introducing a new variable `_owned_tuple` and assigning `tuple` to it, the ownership of `tuple` is transferred within the pattern-matching block. After that point, `tuple` is no longer accessible outside the block. However, this behavior depends on the specific pattern and the actions taken within the block, and it's not a universal characteristic of all pattern-matching constructs.
