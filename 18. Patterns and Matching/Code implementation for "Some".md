# Code implementation for "Some"

How does rust handle if "Some" is "None"?  

Show me the code that rust implements in its internal library for "some."

In Rust, if the `Some` variant is `None`, it means that the variable does not contain a value. Here's an example of how Rust's internal library implements the `Option` type and its `Some` variant:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

impl<T> Option<T> {
    fn is_some(&self) -> bool {
        match *self {
            Some(_) => true,
            None => false,
        }
    }

    fn is_none(&self) -> bool {
        !self.is_some()
    }

    // Other methods and associated functions for Option<T>...
}
```

In this example, the `Option<T>` enum has two variants: `Some(T)` and `None`. The `Some` variant wraps a value of type `T`, representing the presence of a value. The `None` variant represents the absence of a value.

The `Option<T>` type also provides methods to work with the optional value. The `is_some()` method checks if the `Option<T>` is `Some` and returns `true` if it is. The `is_none()` method is the opposite of `is_some()` and returns `true` if the `Option<T>` is `None`.

Please note that this code represents a simplified version of how Rust's `Option` type is implemented internally. The actual implementation may include additional features and optimizations.
