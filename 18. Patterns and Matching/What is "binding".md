# What is "binding"

What does it mean with "binding"? Does it relate to the memory stack or heap?

In programming, "binding" refers to the association of a name (variable) with a value in a particular scope. It is the process of creating a link between a variable name and the memory location where the corresponding value is stored.

The concept of binding is not directly related to the memory stack or heap. Instead, it is a higher-level language construct that deals with how variables are named and associated with values within the program's scope.

When you declare a variable in a programming language, you are essentially creating a...
> binding between the variable name and a memory location where the value of the variable will be stored. 

The variable name acts as a reference or identifier that allows you to access and manipulate the value.

In the context of pattern matching in Rust, binding refers to the creation of a new variable within a pattern match arm. When a pattern match succeeds, the variables in the pattern bind to the corresponding values from the matched data structure.

For example, in Rust, the pattern `Some(value)` binds the value within the `Some` variant to the variable `value`. This creates a binding between the variable name `value` and the memory location that holds the value from the `Some` variant.

The location where the value is stored, whether it is on the stack or heap, depends on the specific data type and its ownership semantics. Variables can hold values that are either stack-allocated (such as primitive types) or heap-allocated (such as dynamically allocated objects like `Box` or `Vec`).

To summarize, binding is the association of a variable name with a value within a particular scope. It does not directly relate to the memory stack or heap but rather represents the link between a variable name and the memory location where the corresponding value is stored.
