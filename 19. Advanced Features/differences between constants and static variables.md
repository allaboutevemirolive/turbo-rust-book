# differences between constants and static variables

Give me exhaustive and detailed list of the differences between constants and static variables in Rust

___


In Rust, constants and static variables are both used for storing values that do not change during the execution of a program. However, there are some key differences between the two. Here is an exhaustive and detailed list of the differences between constants and static variables in Rust:

1. Syntax:
   - Constants are declared using the `const` keyword, followed by the name, type, and value assignment.
   - Static variables are declared using the `static` keyword, followed by the name, type, and optional initializer.

2. Value assignment:
   - Constants must have a compile-time constant value, which means their value must be computable at compile-time. This allows them to be used in any context where a constant expression is expected.
   - Static variables can have a value that is determined at runtime, such as the result of a function call or a value read from a file.

3. Memory allocation:
   - Constants are always inlined wherever they are used. This means that their values are directly substituted into the code at compile-time, and no memory is allocated for them.
   - Static variables are allocated memory in the program's data segment and retain their value throughout the entire execution of the program.

4. Mutability:
   - Constants are always immutable. Once assigned, their value cannot be changed.
   - Static variables can be either mutable or immutable. Mutable static variables are declared using the `static mut` keywords, and their value can be changed using unsafe code.

5. Scoping and visibility:
   - Constants have a block scope and are only visible within the block or module where they are defined.
   - Static variables have a global scope and can be accessed from any part of the program, as long as they are in scope.

6. Type restrictions:
   - Constants can only have types that are allowed in constant expressions. For example, they cannot have types that require runtime initialization or have a size determined at runtime.
   - Static variables can have any type that is valid in Rust, including types that require runtime initialization.

7. Performance implications:
   - Constants are evaluated at compile-time and do not incur any runtime overhead.
   - Static variables have a slight runtime overhead because they require memory allocation and can be modified at runtime.

8. Usage scenarios:
   - Constants are commonly used for defining mathematical or physical constants, like Pi or the speed of light.
   - Static variables are often used for global configuration settings or shared resources that need to be accessed from multiple parts of the program.

It's important to note that both constants and static variables are subject to the Rust type system rules and must follow the usual naming conventions. Additionally, modifying static variables requires using unsafe code blocks due to Rust's memory safety guarantees.
