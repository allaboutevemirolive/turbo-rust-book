# operator overloading is in Rust

Explain to me in detail what operator overloading is in Rust and give me example

In Rust, operator overloading refers to the ability to redefine the behavior of certain operators for user-defined types. By overloading operators, you can define custom implementations of operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, and more for your own types. This allows you to define how your types interact with these operators and enables a more intuitive and expressive code.

To overload an operator in Rust, you need to implement the corresponding trait for your type. Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in other programming languages and provide a way to define behavior that can be shared across multiple types.

Here's an example that demonstrates operator overloading in Rust:

```rust
use std::ops;

// Define a custom Point struct
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

// Implement the Add trait for Point, overloading the '+' operator
impl ops::Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;

    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {
        Point {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let point1 = Point { x: 2, y: 3 };
    let point2 = Point { x: 4, y: 1 };

    let sum = point1 + point2;  // '+' operator is overloaded

    println!("{:?}", sum);  // Output: Point { x: 6, y: 4 }
}
```

In the above example, we define a `Point` struct to represent a point in a two-dimensional space. We then implement the `Add` trait for the `Point` struct, which overloads the `+` operator. Inside the implementation, we define how the addition of two `Point` instances should be performed.

In the `main` function, we create two `Point` instances, `point1` and `point2`. We then use the overloaded `+` operator to add these points together and store the result in the `sum` variable. Finally, we print the result, which gives us the expected output of `Point { x: 6, y: 4 }`.

By overloading operators, you can make your types more expressive and allow them to interact with operators just like built-in types in Rust. Keep in mind that not all operators can be overloaded, as Rust has restrictions on which operators can be overloaded and for which traits. It's important to refer to the Rust documentation for a complete list of overloadable operators and the corresponding traits.
