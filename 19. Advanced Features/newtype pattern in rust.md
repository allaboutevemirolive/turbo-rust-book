# newtype pattern in rust

Explain to me in detail about the newtype of pattern in rust

The "newtype" pattern in Rust is a design pattern that involves creating a new type by wrapping an existing type, usually with the intention of adding new behavior or enforcing type safety. This pattern is implemented using a tuple struct with a single field.

Here's how the newtype pattern works in detail:

1. Define a tuple struct:
   - To create a newtype, you define a tuple struct with a single field. The field represents the underlying type you want to wrap. For example:

     ```rust
     struct NewType(i32);
     ```

     In this example, `NewType` is a tuple struct that wraps an `i32` value.

2. Implement traits and methods:
   - Once you have defined the newtype, you can implement traits and methods specifically for that newtype. This allows you to add behavior or enforce specific rules for the wrapped type. For example:

     ```rust
     impl NewType {
         fn double(&self) -> i32 {
             self.0 * 2
         }
     }
     ```

     In this case, the `double` method is implemented for `NewType`, which returns the double of the wrapped `i32` value.

3. Use the newtype:
   - You can now create instances of the newtype and utilize its behavior. The newtype can be used anywhere its underlying type would be used, but with the added behavior you have implemented. For example:

     ```rust
     fn main() {
         let new_value = NewType(5);
         println!("Double of the newtype: {}", new_value.double());
     }
     ```

     This code creates an instance of `NewType` with the value `5` and then calls the `double` method to print the double of the wrapped value, which is `10`.

The newtype pattern provides a way to create a distinct type while reusing the behavior and traits of the underlying type. It offers benefits such as improved type safety and expressiveness in the code. It can also be used to prevent accidentally mixing different types that are semantically different but have the same underlying representation.

Additionally, the newtype pattern is useful for encapsulation and abstraction. It allows you to hide implementation details and expose a specific interface or behavior for a type, which can be beneficial for maintaining code clarity and reducing potential errors.

Overall, the newtype pattern in Rust is a simple and effective way to create distinct types by wrapping an existing type, enabling you to add behavior and enforce type safety in a straightforward manner.
