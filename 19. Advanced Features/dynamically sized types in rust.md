# dynamically sized types in rust

Explain to me in detail about dynamically sized types in rust

Dynamically Sized Types (DSTs) in Rust are types whose size is not known at compile time and can only be determined at runtime. They are typically used when dealing with types that have variable or unknown sizes, such as slices (`[T]`) and trait objects (`dyn Trait`).

In Rust, most types have a fixed size known at compile time. For example, `i32` occupies 4 bytes, and `bool` occupies 1 byte. This allows the Rust compiler to allocate memory for these types in a static and deterministic manner.

However, dynamically sized types don't have a fixed size at compile time, and their size depends on the data they contain or the type they represent. As a result, Rust uses indirection to store and manage dynamically sized types.

Here are a few examples of dynamically sized types in Rust:

1. Slices (`[T]`):
   - Slices represent a contiguous sequence of elements of type `T`. Since the length of a slice can vary, the size of `[T]` is not known at compile time. Instead, it consists of a fat pointer, which is a pair of a pointer to the data and a length. For example, `&[i32]` is a dynamically sized type.

2. Trait objects (`dyn Trait`):
   - Trait objects allow dynamic dispatch for trait implementations. They represent a type-erased version of a trait, which means the size of the underlying concrete type implementing the trait is unknown. Trait objects are represented as a pair of a vtable (virtual table) pointer and a data pointer. For example, `Box<dyn SomeTrait>` is a dynamically sized type.

3. `str`:
   - The `str` type represents a UTF-8 encoded string slice. It is a dynamically sized type because its size depends on the length of the string it represents. Similar to slices, `str` is represented as a fat pointer, consisting of a pointer to the string's data and a length.

Dynamically sized types cannot be used directly as fields in a struct or as the sole type of an array. However, they can be used behind a pointer type, such as references (`&T`), boxes (`Box<T>`), or `Rc<T>`.

To work with dynamically sized types, Rust provides several built-in traits, such as `Sized`, `Deref`, and `CoerceUnsized`, which enable automatic coercion and dereferencing for DSTs.

It's worth noting that the Rust language provides some limitations and restrictions when dealing with dynamically sized types to ensure memory safety and prevent undefined behavior. For instance, DSTs cannot be used as function arguments or return types directly. Instead, they are typically used through references or smart pointers to provide a known size and manage the indirection.

Overall, dynamically sized types in Rust are used to handle types whose size is not known at compile time. They use indirection, such as fat pointers, to manage the variable-sized data and enable dynamic dispatch, providing flexibility and runtime polymorphism.
