# fully qualified syntax in Rust

Explain to me in detail what fully qualified syntax is in rust and give me examples

In Rust, fully qualified syntax refers to the 

> explicit use of the complete path to access a function, trait, or associated item within a module hierarchy. 

It allows you to specify the exact location of the item you want to use, even if it is not in the current scope. Fully qualified syntax is useful when there are naming conflicts or when you want to be explicit about the origin of the item.

Here are some examples to illustrate the usage of fully qualified syntax in Rust:

1. Accessing a function from another module:
```rust
mod module1 {
    pub fn foo() {
        println!("This is foo() from module1");
    }
}

mod module2 {
    pub fn foo() {
        println!("This is foo() from module2");
    }
}

fn main() {
    module1::foo();  // Accessing foo() from module1
    module2::foo();  // Accessing foo() from module2
}
```

In this example, there are two modules, `module1` and `module2`, both containing a function named `foo()`. By using the fully qualified syntax `module1::foo()` and `module2::foo()`, we can explicitly specify which `foo()` function we want to call, avoiding any naming conflicts.

2. Accessing a trait's associated item:
```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn my_func();
}

struct MyStruct;

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn my_func() {
        println!("Implementing my_func() for MyStruct");
    }
}

fn main() {
    <MyStruct as MyTrait>::my_func();  // Accessing my_func() through fully qualified syntax
}
```

In this example, we have a trait `MyTrait` with an associated function `my_func()`. We implement the `MyTrait` for the `MyStruct` struct and provide a specific implementation for `my_func()`. To invoke the `my_func()` implementation for `MyStruct`, we use fully qualified syntax `<MyStruct as MyTrait>::my_func()`.

By using the fully qualified syntax, we explicitly state that we want to call `my_func()` associated with the `MyStruct` type as defined by the `MyTrait` trait.

Fully qualified syntax is particularly useful in scenarios where there are ambiguities or naming conflicts, allowing you to be explicit about the intended item you want to access. It ensures clarity and helps avoid potential issues related to naming collisions or mistaken identifications.
