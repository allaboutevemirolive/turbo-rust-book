# initializer function in rust

Explain to me in detail about initializer function in rust

___


In Rust, an initializer function is a function that is responsible for initializing a value or setting up the initial state of a data structure. It is commonly used when creating complex objects or performing initialization logic that goes beyond the capabilities of the default `new` constructor.

Initializer functions are often associated with the `impl` block of a struct or an enum, and they provide a way to customize the creation of instances by accepting parameters and performing specific setup operations.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of an initializer function:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn new() -> Point {
        Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
    }

    fn with_coordinates(x: i32, y: i32) -> Point {
        Point { x, y }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Point` struct represents a point in a 2D coordinate system with `x` and `y` values. The `impl` block provides two initializer functions: `new` and `with_coordinates`.

- The `new` function is a common convention for creating a default instance of a struct. In this case, it initializes a `Point` with both `x` and `y` set to zero.

- The `with_coordinates` function accepts `x` and `y` as parameters and creates a `Point` instance with the provided values.

These initializer functions provide flexibility and allow the user of the struct to choose the most appropriate way to create instances based on their specific needs. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let default_point = Point::new();
    let custom_point = Point::with_coordinates(3, 5);
}
```

In this `main` function, we create two instances of `Point`. The `default_point` is created using the `new` initializer, which sets both `x` and `y` to zero. The `custom_point` is created using the `with_coordinates` initializer, providing values `3` and `5` for `x` and `y`, respectively.

Initializer functions are not limited to structs and can also be used with enums or any other type that requires initialization. They offer a way to encapsulate the creation logic and provide clear and concise interfaces for constructing instances of a type.

In summary, initializer functions in Rust provide a means to customize the creation of instances by accepting parameters and performing specific setup operations. They offer flexibility and allow users to create objects with different initial states based on their specific requirements.
