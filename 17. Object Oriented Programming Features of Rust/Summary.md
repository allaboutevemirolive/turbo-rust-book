# Summary

No matter whether or not you think Rust is an object-oriented language after reading this chapter, you now know that you can use trait objects to get some object-oriented features in Rust.

Dynamic dispatch can give your code some flexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance.

You can use this flexibility to implement object-oriented patterns that can help your code’s maintainability.

Rust also has other features, like ownership, that object-oriented languages don’t have.

An object-oriented pattern won’t always be the best way to take advantage of Rust’s strengths, but is an available option.



Next, we’ll look at patterns, which are another of Rust’s features that enable lots of flexibility.

We’ve looked at them briefly throughout the book but haven’t seen their full capability yet.
