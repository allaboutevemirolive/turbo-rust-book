# bounded parametric polymorphism

What is "bounded parametric polymorphism" in rust?

___

Bounded parametric polymorphism is a term used to describe a form of polymorphism in programming languages where generic code can operate on different types while imposing constraints on those types.

In Rust, bounded parametric polymorphism is achieved through the use of generics and trait bounds. Generics allow you to write code that can work with multiple types by using type parameters as placeholders for the actual types. These type parameters are not bound to any specific concrete type during compilation.

Trait bounds are used in conjunction with generics to impose constraints on the types that can be used with the generic code. Traits define a set of methods that types can implement, and by specifying trait bounds on generic type parameters, you require that the types used with the generic code implement certain traits or provide specific functionality.

The combination of generics and trait bounds in Rust provides bounded parametric polymorphism. The "bounded" aspect refers to the constraints imposed on the types that can be used with the generic code. The "parametric" aspect indicates that the generic code operates on parameters (type parameters) without requiring knowledge of the specific types at compile time.

Bounded parametric polymorphism allows you to write generic functions, structs, and traits that can be used with different types, as long as those types satisfy the specified trait bounds. This enables code reuse, as generic code can be written once and used with a variety of types, promoting flexibility and maintainability while ensuring type safety.
