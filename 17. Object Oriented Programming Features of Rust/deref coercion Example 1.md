What is the purpose of "struct MatrixIntoIterator"

___


The purpose of the `struct MatrixIntoIterator` is to define a custom iterator for the `Matrix` type. It provides an implementation of the `Iterator` trait, allowing us to iterate over the elements of the matrix in a specific order.

The `MatrixIntoIterator` struct holds the necessary state to keep track of the current position (row and column) while iterating over the matrix. It contains fields `matrix`, `row`, and `col`. The `matrix` field stores the `Matrix` instance being iterated, and `row` and `col` keep track of the current position within the matrix.

The `Iterator` trait requires implementing the `next` method, which is responsible for returning the next element in the iterator sequence. In this case, the `next` method is implemented to retrieve elements from the matrix in row-major order.

When `next` is called, it checks if there are more rows to iterate (`self.row < self.matrix.data.len()`). If there are, it retrieves the value at the current position (`self.matrix.data[self.row][self.col]`). Then, it updates the position by incrementing the column (`self.col += 1`). If the column exceeds the length of the current row, it moves to the next row (`self.row += 1`) and resets the column to 0. Finally, it returns the retrieved value wrapped in `Some`.

Once all the elements have been exhausted, `next` returns `None`, indicating the end of the iteration.

By implementing the `Iterator` trait for `MatrixIntoIterator`, we can use it with various iterator methods and collect the elements into different container types or perform other operations.

In the provided example, we use `MatrixIntoIterator` in the `into_iter` method of the `IntoIterator` trait implementation for `Matrix`. This allows us to consume the `Matrix` instance and obtain an iterator that iterates over its elements.

Explain to me how this code works

```rust
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        if self.row < self.matrix.data.len() {
            let val = self.matrix.data[self.row][self.col];
            self.col += 1;
            if self.col >= self.matrix.data[self.row].len() {
                self.row += 1;
                self.col = 0;
            }
            Some(val)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
```

The `next` method implementation within the `MatrixIntoIterator` struct is responsible for providing the next element in the iterator sequence. Let's break down how it works:

1. The method signature indicates that `next` takes a mutable reference to `self` (the iterator) and returns an `Option<Self::Item>`. The `Self::Item` associated type represents the type of the elements being iterated, which in this case is `i32` since we are iterating over a matrix of integers.

2. The first line of the method checks whether the current row index, `self.row`, is less than the total number of rows in the matrix, `self.matrix.data.len()`. If there are still more rows to iterate, the condition evaluates to `true`, and we continue to the next steps. Otherwise, if there are no more rows, the iterator has reached the end, and `None` is returned to indicate the end of iteration.

3. Inside the `if` block, we access the value at the current position within the matrix. The expression `self.matrix.data[self.row][self.col]` retrieves the element at the current row, `self.row`, and column, `self.col`. This value is stored in the `val` variable.

4. The `self.col += 1` line increments the column index, `self.col`, to move to the next column within the current row.

5. Following that, an `if` statement checks if the current column index exceeds or is equal to the length of the current row, `self.matrix.data[self.row].len()`. If this condition evaluates to `true`, it means we have reached the end of the current row and need to move to the next row.

6. Inside the `if` block, we increment the row index, `self.row`, to move to the next row, and set the column index, `self.col`, to 0 to start iterating from the beginning of the new row.

7. Finally, we return the previously stored value, `val`, wrapped in `Some`, indicating a successful iteration step. The next time `next` is called, it will resume from the updated position in the matrix.

8. If the iterator has reached the end of the matrix (all rows and columns have been iterated), the `else` block is executed, and `None` is returned to indicate the end of iteration.

In summary, the `next` method is responsible for providing the next element in the iterator sequence by traversing the matrix in row-major order. It updates the internal state of the iterator (row and column indices) after each element is retrieved. When there are no more elements to iterate, it returns `None`.
