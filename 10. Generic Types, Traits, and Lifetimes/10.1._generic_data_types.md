## Generic Data Types

We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types.

Let’s first look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and methods using generics.

Then we’ll discuss how generics affect code performance.


## In Function Definitions

When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the signature of the function where we would usually specify the data types of the parameters and return value.

Doing so makes our code more flexible and provides more functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.


Continuing with our `largest` function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions that both find the largest value in a slice.

We'll then combine these into a single function that uses generics.


Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

Listing 10-4: Two functions that differ only in their names and the types in their signatures

The `largest_i32` function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that finds the largest i32 in a slice.

The `largest_char` function finds the largest char in a slice.

The function bodies have the same code, so let’s eliminate the duplication by introducing a generic type parameter in a single function.


To parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the type parameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function.

You can use any identifier as a type parameter name.

But we’ll use `T` because, by convention, 
- type parameter names in Rust are short, often just a letter, and 
- Rust’s type-naming convention is UpperCamelCase.

Short for “type,” T is the default choice of most Rust programmers.


When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the parameter name in the signature so the compiler knows what that name means.

Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function signature, we have to declare the type parameter name before we use it.

To define the generic largest function, place type name declarations inside angle brackets, `<>`, between the name of the function and the parameter list, like this:

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
```

We read this definition as: the function largest is generic over some type T.

This function has one parameter named list, which is a slice of values of type T.

The largest function will return a reference to a value of the same type T.

Listing 10-5 shows the combined largest function definition using the generic data type in its signature.

The listing also shows how we can call the function with either a slice of `i32` values or `char` values.

Note that this code won’t compile yet, but we’ll fix it later in this chapter.

Filename: src/main.rs

This code does not compile!

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

If we compile this code right now, we’ll get this error:

```

The help text mentions `std::cmp::PartialOrd`, which is a trait, and we’re going to talk about traits in the next section.

For now, know that this error states that the body of largest won’t work for all possible types that T could be.

Because we want to compare values of type T in the body, we can only use types whose values can be ordered.

To enable comparisons, the standard library has the `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait that you can implement on types (see Appendix C for more on this trait).

By following the help text's suggestion, we restrict the types valid for T to only those that implement `PartialOrd` and this example will compile, because the standard library implements `PartialOrd` on both `i32` and `char`.

Appendage QA:

```
What is `PartialOrd + Copy` in the code above?
```
In the code above, `PartialOrd + Copy` is a trait bound used to specify the requirements for the generic type `T` in the `largest` function signature.

- `PartialOrd` is a trait in Rust that represents types that can be compared for ordering. It defines methods like `gt`, `lt`, `ge`, `le`, etc., which allow comparing two values and determining their relative order. By specifying `PartialOrd`, we ensure that the elements in the list can be compared using operators like `>` or `<`.

- `Copy` is another trait in Rust that represents types that can be copied by simply duplicating the bits. By specifying `Copy`, we ensure that the elements in the list can be copied without any ownership or borrowing issues. This is necessary because the function `largest` wants to return a value directly instead of a reference.

By using `PartialOrd + Copy` as trait bounds for `T`, we ensure that the elements in the list can be compared and copied, allowing the function to correctly find and return the largest element.


```
Where are generics applicable in Rust?
```
Generics in Rust are applicable in various parts of the language, providing a powerful and flexible way to write code that can work with different types. Here are some common places where generics can be used in Rust:

1. `Functions`: Rust allows you to define generic functions that can operate on different types. This enables you to write reusable code that works with a wide range of data types.

2. `Structs`: Generics can be used when defining structs, allowing you to create data structures that are generic over types. This enables you to define generic containers or data structures that can hold different kinds of values.

3. `Enums`: Similar to structs, enums can also be made generic. This allows you to define generic variants that can have associated values of different types.

4. `Traits`: Generics are often used in combination with traits. You can define generic traits that can be implemented by multiple types, enabling polymorphism and code reuse.

5. `Methods`: Rust allows you to define generic methods that are associated with a particular struct or enum. These methods can operate on the generic type parameters defined by the struct or enum.

6. `Associated Types`: Generics can also be used to define associated types within traits. This allows trait implementors to choose concrete types that satisfy the requirements of the associated type.

Generics in Rust provide a way to write code that is abstract and reusable across different types while maintaining strong type safety. They enable you to write efficient and flexible code without sacrificing performance or safety.

    }

## In Struct Definitions

We can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more fields using the `<>` syntax.

Listing 10-6 defines a `Point<T>` struct to hold x and y coordinate values of any type.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```

Listing 10-6: A `Point<T>` struct that holds x and y values of type T

The syntax for using generics in struct definitions is similar to that used in function definitions.

First, we declare the name of the type parameter inside angle brackets just after the name of the struct.

Then we use the generic type in the struct definition where we would otherwise specify concrete data types.


Note that because we’ve used only one generic type to define `Point<T>`, this definition says that the `Point<T>` struct is generic over some type T, and the fields x and y are both that same type, whatever that type may be.

If we create an instance of a `Point<T>` that has values of different types, as in Listing 10-7, our code won’t compile.


Filename: src/main.rs

This code does not compile!

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

Listing 10-7: The fields x and y must be the same type because both have the same generic data type T.


In this example, when we assign the integer value 5 to x, we let the compiler know that the generic type T will be an integer for this instance of `Point<T>`.

Then when we specify 4.0 for y, which we’ve defined to have the same type as x, we’ll get a type mismatch error like this:

```rust
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:38
  |

  |                                      ^^^ expected integer, found floating-point number

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` due to previous error
```

To define a Point struct where x and y are both generics but could have different types, we can use `multiple generic type parameters`.

For example, in Listing 10-8, we change the definition of 
    Point to be generic over types T and U 
    where x is of type `T` and y is of type `U`.


Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

Listing 10-8: A Point<T, U> generic over two types so that x and y can be values of different types

Now all the instances of `Point` shown are allowed!

You can use as many generic type parameters in a definition as you want, but using more than a few makes your code hard to read.

If you're finding you need lots of generic types in your code, it could indicate that your code needs restructuring into smaller pieces.

Appendage  QA :

```
Give me examples of different types of generics and generics implementation methods that I should be aware of.
```
Certainly! Here are some examples of different types of generics and generic implementation methods in Rust:

1. Generic Functions:
   ```rust
   fn print_pair<T, U>(x: T, y: U) {
       println!("Value 1: {:?}", x);
       println!("Value 2: {:?}", y);
   }
   ```
   Generic functions allow you to write a single function that can operate on different types. The type parameters `T` and `U` can represent any valid Rust type.

2. Generic Structs:
   ```rust
   struct Pair<T, U> {
       x: T,
       y: U,
   }
   ```
   Generic structs enable you to define a struct that can hold different types for its fields. The type parameters `T` and `U` can be replaced with any specific types when using the struct.

3. Generic Enums:
   ```rust
   enum Result<T, E> {
       Ok(T),
       Err(E),
   }
   ```
   Generic enums provide a way to define an enum that can have variants parameterized by different types. The `Result` enum is a commonly used example, where `T` represents the success value and `E` represents the error value.

4. Trait Bounds:
   ```rust
   fn process<T: Debug>(value: T) {
       println!("Value: {:?}", value);
   }
   ```
   Trait bounds allow you to specify that a generic type parameter must implement certain traits. In the example above, `T: Debug` requires the type `T` to implement the `Debug` trait, which enables the use of the `{:?}` format specifier.

5. Associated Types:
   ```rust
   trait Convert<T> {
       type Output;
       fn convert(self) -> Self::Output;
   }
   ```
   Associated types are used in trait definitions to associate a type with the trait itself. Implementations of the trait can define the associated type, which can depend on the specific types involved. It allows for more flexibility in trait design.

6. Generic Implementations:
   ```rust
   impl<T> MyStruct<T> {
       fn new(value: T) -> Self {
           MyStruct { field: value }
       }
   }
   ```
   Generic implementations allow you to provide generic methods specifically for a generic type. In this example, the `new` method is implemented for `MyStruct<T>`, where `T` can be any type.

These are just a few examples of the different types of generics and generic implementation methods in Rust. They provide powerful tools for writing reusable and flexible code that can work with various types.

}

    type Output;

    fn convert(self) -> Self::Output;
}

    // Using the generic trait
    let num: i32 = 3.14f64.convert();
    println!("Converted number: {}", num);
}

```

## In Enum Definitions

As we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types in their variants.

Let’s take another look at the Option<T> enum that the standard library provides, which we used in Chapter 6:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

This definition should now make more sense to you.

As you can see, the `Option<T>` enum is generic over type `T` and has two variants: 
- `Some`, which holds one value of type T, and a 
- `None` variant that doesn’t hold any value.

By using the `Option<T>` enum, we can express the abstract concept of an optional value, and because `Option<T>` is generic, we can use this abstraction no matter what the type of the optional value is.


Enums can use multiple generic types as well.

The definition of the `Result` enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The `Result` enum is generic over two types, `T` and `E`, and has two variants: 
- `Ok`, which holds a value of type `T`, and 
- `Err`, which holds a value of type `E`.

This definition makes it convenient to use the `Result` enum anywhere we have an operation that might 
- succeed (return a value of some type T) or 
- fail (return an error of some type E).

In fact, this is what we used to open a file in Listing 9-3, where 
- `T` was filled in with the type `std::fs::File` when the file was opened successfully and 
- `E` was filled in with the type `std::io::Error` when there were problems opening the file.


When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can avoid duplication by using generic types instead.


## In Method Definitions

We can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in Chapter 5) and use generic types in their definitions, too.

Listing 10-9 shows the `Point<T>` struct we defined in Listing 10-6 with a method named x implemented on it.


Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

Listing 10-9: Implementing a method named `x` on the `Point<T>` struct that will return a reference to the `x` field of type `T`

Here, we’ve defined a method named `x` on `Point<T>` that returns a reference to the data in the field x.


Note that we have to declare `T` just after impl so we can use `T` to specify that we’re implementing methods on the type `Point<T>`.

By declaring `T` as a generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the angle brackets in Point is a generic type rather than a concrete type.

We could have chosen a different name for this generic parameter than the generic parameter declared in the struct definition, but using the same name is conventional.

Methods written within an `impl` that declares the generic type will be defined on any instance of the type, no matter what concrete type ends up substituting for the generic type.


We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the type.

We could, for example, implement methods only on `Point<f32>` instances rather than on `Point<T>` instances with any generic type.

```
Explain to me in details about why we need impl and struct in the code below
```
```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
    
    fn y(&self) -> &T {
        &self.y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
    println!("p.y = {}", p.y());
}
```
In the given code, the `struct` and `impl` keywords are used to define a generic type `Point<T>` and its implementation respectively. Let's go through each of them in detail:

1. `struct Point<T> { ... }`:
   - The `struct` keyword is used to define a new struct named `Point`.
   - `<T>` indicates that `Point` is a generic type that can work with any type `T`.
   - Inside the struct, there are two fields `x` and `y` of type `T`. These fields represent the coordinates of a point.

2. `impl<T> Point<T> { ... }`:
   - The `impl` keyword is used to define the implementation of methods associated with the `Point<T>` struct.
   - `<T>` indicates that this implementation is generic and works for any type `T`.
   - The `Point<T>` after `impl` specifies that we are implementing methods for the `Point` struct with the generic type `T`.

3. `fn x(&self) -> &T { ... }`:
   - `fn` is the keyword to define a new function.
   - `x(&self)` is a method associated with the `Point<T>` struct, which takes a shared reference to `self` (the instance of `Point<T>`) as the first argument.
   - `-> &T` specifies that the method returns a shared reference to a value of type `T`.
   - `&self.x` returns a reference to the `x` field of the struct.

4. `fn y(&self) -> &T { ... }`:
   - This is similar to the `x` method, but it returns a shared reference to the `y` field of the struct.

5. `let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };`:
   - This line creates a new instance of `Point<T>` by providing concrete values for the `x` and `y` fields.
   - Since `Point<T>` is generic, the compiler infers the type based on the values provided. In this case, it becomes `Point<i32>`, where `i32` is the type of the values `5` and `10`.

6. `println!("p.x = {}", p.x());` and `println!("p.y = {}", p.y());`:
   - These lines print the values of `p.x()` and `p.y()` respectively.
   - `p.x()` and `p.y()` are method calls on the `p` instance of `Point<T>`.
   - The methods return references to the `x` and `y` fields, which are then dereferenced (`*`) by the `println!` macro to print their values.

In summary, the `struct` keyword is used to define a generic `Point<T>` struct with `x` and `y` fields, while the `impl` keyword is used to implement methods associated with the `Point<T>` struct. 

This allows us to create instances of `Point<T>` and call methods on them to access their `x` and `y` values. 

The use of generics (`<T>`) allows the `Point` struct to be flexible and work with different types.

```
Include in the code above so i can insert for different types of values for x and y
```

To modify the code so that you can insert different types of values for `x` and `y`, you need to make the `Point<T>` struct and its methods generic. Here's an updated version of the code that allows you to specify different types for `x` and `y`:

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

impl<T, U> Point<T, U> {
    fn new(x: T, y: U) -> Point<T, U> {
        Point { x, y }
    }

    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }

    fn y(&self) -> &U {
        &self.y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point::new(5, 10);         // Point<i32, i32>
    let p2 = Point::new(3.14, 2.718);   // Point<f64, f64>
    let p3 = Point::new("Hello", 'c');  // Point<&str, char>

    println!("p1.x = {}", p1.x());
    println!("p1.y = {}", p1.y());

    println!("p2.x = {}", p2.x());
    println!("p2.y = {}", p2.y());

    println!("p3.x = {}", p3.x());
    println!("p3.y = {}", p3.y());
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `Point<T, U>` struct now has two type parameters, `T` and `U`. These parameters represent the types of `x` and `y` respectively.

2. The `impl<T, U> Point<T, U>` block now declares the generic types `T` and `U` for the implementation of methods associated with the `Point<T, U>` struct.

3. The `new` method has been added to create a new instance of `Point<T, U>` by providing values for `x` and `y` of corresponding types `T` and `U`.

4. In the `main` function, three instances of `Point<T, U>` are created with different types for `x` and `y`. You can see examples of `Point<i32, i32>`, `Point<f64, f64>`, and `Point<&str, char>`.

5. The `println!` statements inside `main` print the values of `x` and `y` for each instance using the `x()` and `y()` methods respectively.

With these changes, you can now create `Point` instances with different types for `x` and `y` by providing appropriate values to the `new` method.

        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}

impl Point<i32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        ((self.x.pow(2) + self.y.pow(2)) as f32).sqrt()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let q = Point { x: 10.0, y: 20.0 };

    println!("p.distance_from_origin = {}", p.distance_from_origin());
    println!("q.distance_from_origin = {}", q.distance_from_origin());
}
```
Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step and understand each component:

1. `struct Point<T> { ... }`:
   - The `struct` keyword is used to define a new struct named `Point`.
   - `<T>` indicates that `Point` is a generic type that can work with any type `T`.
   - Inside the struct, there are two fields `x` and `y` of type `T`. These fields represent the coordinates of a point.

2. `impl Point<f32> { ... }`:
   - The `impl` keyword is used to define the implementation of methods associated with the `Point<f32>` specialization of the `Point<T>` struct.
   - `Point<f32>` means that the implementation is specific to the case where `T` is `f32`, representing floating-point numbers.
   - The implementation includes a `distance_from_origin` method, which calculates the distance of the point from the origin (0, 0) using the Pythagorean theorem.
   - The method uses the `powi` method to raise `x` and `y` to the power of 2, then adds them together, takes the square root using the `sqrt` method, and returns the result as an `f32`.

3. `impl Point<i32> { ... }`:
   - Similarly to the previous implementation, this `impl` block provides the specialization for the `Point<i32>` case, where `T` is `i32`, representing integer numbers.
   - The `distance_from_origin` method is implemented in the same way as before but includes a cast to `f32` after the calculations since the return type of the method is `f32`.

4. `fn main() { ... }`:
   - The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program.
   - Inside `main`, two instances of the `Point` struct are created:
     - `p` is of type `Point<i32>` with `x` as 5 and `y` as 10.
     - `q` is of type `Point<f32>` with `x` as 10.0 and `y` as 20.0.
   - These instances demonstrate the usage of different types (`i32` and `f32`) for `x` and `y` in the generic `Point` struct.

5. `println!("p.distance_from_origin = {}", p.distance_from_origin());` and `println!("q.distance_from_origin = {}", q.distance_from_origin());`:
   - These lines print the distances from the origin calculated using the `distance_from_origin` method for `p` and `q`.
   - The `distance_from_origin` method is called on each instance, and its return value is printed using the `println!` macro.

In summary, the code defines a generic `Point<T>` struct that represents a point with coordinates `x` and `y`. 

It then provides specialized implementations of the `distance_from_origin` method for `Point<f32>` and `Point<i32>`. 

The main function creates instances of `Point<i32>` and `Point<f32>`, and it calculates and prints the distances of these points from the origin using the specialized implementations.

In Listing 10-10 we use the concrete type f32, meaning we don’t declare any types after impl.


Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

Listing 10-10: An impl block that only applies to a struct with a particular concrete type for the generic type parameter T

This code means the type `Point<f32>` will have a `distance_from_origin` method; other instances of `Point<T>` where `T` is not of type `f32` will not have this method defined.

The method measures how far our point is from the point at coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical operations that are available only for floating point types.


Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren’t always the same as those you use in that same struct’s method signatures.

Listing 10-11 uses the generic types X1 and Y1 for the Point struct and X2 Y2 for the mixup method signature to make the example clearer.

The method creates a new `Point` instance with the 
- `x` value from the self Point (of type X1) and the 
- `y` value from the passed-in Point (of type Y2).


Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
struct Point<X1, Y1> {
    x: X1,
    y: Y1,
}

impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```

Listing 10-11: A method that uses generic types different from its struct’s definition

In main, we’ve defined for p1 variable, a `Point` that has 
- an i32 for x (with value 5) and 
- an f64 for y (with value 10.4).

The p2 variable is a `Point` struct that has 
- a string slice for x (with value "Hello") and 
- a char for y (with value c).

Calling mixup on p1 with the argument p2 gives us p3, which will have an `i32` for `x`, because x came from p1.

The `p3` variable will have a `char` for `y`, because y came from p2.

The `println!` macro call will print p3.x = 5, p3.y = c.

```rust

impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {

    }
}

fn main() {

    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```
Sure! Let's break down the code and understand its components:

1. `struct Point<X1, Y1> { ... }`:
   - The `struct` keyword is used to define a new struct named `Point`.
   - `<X1, Y1>` indicates that `Point` is a generic type that can accept any two types `X1` and `Y1`.
   - Inside the struct, there are two fields `x` and `y` with type parameters `X1` and `Y1` respectively. These fields represent the coordinates of a point.

2. `impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> { ... }`:
   - The `impl` keyword is used to define the implementation of methods associated with the generic `Point` struct.
   - `<X1, Y1>` indicates that the implementation is generic and can work with any types `X1` and `Y1`.
   - The implementation includes a `mixup` method that takes another `Point` instance (`other`) with potentially different type parameters `X2` and `Y2`.
   - The `mixup` method constructs and returns a new `Point` instance by combining the `x` value of the current `self` instance with the `y` value of the `other` instance.

3. `fn main() { ... }`:
   - The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program.
   - Inside `main`, two instances of the `Point` struct are created:
     - `p1` is of type `Point<i32, f64>` with `x` as 5 and `y` as 10.4.
     - `p2` is of type `Point<&str, char>` with `x` as "Hello" and `y` as 'c'.
   - These instances demonstrate the usage of different types for the generic parameters `X1`, `Y1`, `X2`, and `Y2`.

4. `let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);`:
   - This line invokes the `mixup` method on the `p1` instance, passing `p2` as the argument.
   - The method combines the `x` value of `p1` and the `y` value of `p2` to create a new `Point` instance with the type parameters `X1` and `Y2`.
   - The resulting `Point` instance is assigned to `p3`.

5. `println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);`:
   - This line prints the values of `p3.x` and `p3.y` using the `println!` macro.
   - The values are accessed directly from the `p3` instance, showcasing that the `mixup` method successfully mixed the types of `x` and `y` in the resulting instance.

In summary, the code defines a generic `Point<X1, Y1>` struct that represents a point with coordinates `x` and `y` of types `X1` and `Y1` respectively. 

It also provides a generic `mixup` method that can combine the `x` value of one `Point` instance with the `y` value of another `Point` instance to create a new `Point` instance with potentially different type parameters. 

The main function demonstrates the usage of this struct and method by creating instances with different type combinations and printing the resulting mixed-up instance's values.

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which 
- some generic parameters are declared with `impl` and 
- some generic parameters are declared with the `method definition`.

Here, the generic parameters X1 and Y1 are declared after `impl` because they go with the struct definition.

The generic parameters X2 and Y2 are declared after fn `mixup`, because they’re only relevant to the method.


## Performance of Code Using Generics

You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when using generic type parameters.

The good news is that using generic types won't make your program run any slower than it would with concrete types.


Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using generics at compile time.

`Monomorphization` is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.

In this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used to create the generic function in Listing 10-5: the compiler looks at all the places where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types the generic code is called with.


Let’s look at how this works by using the standard library’s generic `Option<T>` enum:

```rust
let integer = Some(5);
let float = Some(5.0);
```

When Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization.

During that process, the compiler reads the values that have been used in `Option<T>` instances and identifies two kinds of `Option<T>`: 
- one is i32 and the 
- other is f64.

As such, it expands the generic definition of `Option<T>` into two definitions specialized to `i32` and `f64`, thereby replacing the generic definition with the specific ones.


The monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following (the compiler uses different names than what we’re using here for illustration):

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}

enum Option_f64 {
    Some(f64),
    None,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}
```

The generic `Option<T>` is replaced with the specific definitions created by the compiler.

Because Rust compiles generic code into code that specifies the type in each instance, we pay no runtime cost for using generics.

When the code runs, it performs just as it would if we had duplicated each definition by hand.

The process of monomorphization makes Rust’s generics extremely efficient at runtime.

```
Explain monomorphization in Rust to me in simple terms.
```
Monomorphization is a process in Rust that transforms generic code into specific code for each concrete type used. In simple terms, it means that when you write generic code that can work with different types, Rust generates specialized versions of that code for each type you actually use.

Let's take an example to illustrate this concept. Suppose you have a generic function called `add` that adds two values together:

```rust
fn add<T>(a: T, b: T) -> T {
    a + b
}
```

In this case, `T` is a generic type parameter that can represent any type. When you call this `add` function with specific types, Rust will generate specialized versions of the function for each type:

```rust
let result_i32 = add(5, 10);      // Rust generates specialized code for i32
let result_f32 = add(3.14, 2.71); // Rust generates specialized code for f32
let result_string = add("Hello", "World"); // Rust generates specialized code for strings
```

Rust does this monomorphization process at compile-time, where it analyzes the usage of generic code and generates specialized versions of the code for each concrete type it encounters. This has several benefits:

1. Performance: Monomorphization eliminates the need for runtime type checks and dispatch, allowing the generated code to be as efficient as code written specifically for each type.

2. Code Size: By generating specialized code, Rust avoids creating a single, large monolithic function that can handle all possible types. This results in smaller compiled binaries.

3. Type Safety: Each specialized version of the code is type-checked, ensuring that the operations are valid for the specific types used.

In summary, monomorphization is the process in Rust where generic code is transformed into specialized code for each specific type it is used with. 

This enables efficient and type-safe execution while keeping the code concise and modular.
