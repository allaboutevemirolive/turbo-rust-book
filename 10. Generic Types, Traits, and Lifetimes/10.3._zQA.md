How do you read this in Rust?

```rust
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
```

In Rust, the line of code you provided can be read as follows:

1. `let s`: This declares a new variable named `s`.

2. `: &'static str`: This specifies the type of the variable `s` as a reference (`&`) to a string slice (`str`) with the `'static` lifetime.

3. `= "I have a static lifetime.";`: This assigns the string literal `"I have a static lifetime."` to the variable `s`.

The `&'static str` type annotation indicates that `s` is a reference to a string slice (`str`) with the `'static` lifetime. The `'static` lifetime means that the reference is valid for the entire duration of the program. In other words, the referenced string slice will exist for the entire lifetime of the program, and you can safely access it without worrying about it being deallocated or becoming invalid.

Therefore, the variable `s` holds a reference to the string `"I have a static lifetime."` that will be available and valid throughout the entire execution of the program.

How do I read this in Rust? 

```rust
fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str,
    ann: T,
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
// code
}
```

To read the given code in Rust, you can break it down and understand its components step by step:

1. Function Declaration:
   - The code begins with the declaration of a function named `longest_with_an_announcement`.
   - The function takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `ann`.
     - `x` and `y` are references to string slices (`&'a str`) that have a lifetime `'a`.
     - `ann` is a generic parameter of type `T`.
   
2. Trait Bound:
   - Following the parameter list, there is a `where` clause specifying a trait bound.
   - The bound specifies that the type `T` must implement the `Display` trait.
   
3. Function Body:
   - After the function declaration and trait bound, there is a function body denoted by the opening and closing curly braces.
   - The actual implementation of the function is missing in the provided code snippet, indicated by the comment `// code`.
   - You would need to fill in the function body with the desired logic.

To complete the implementation, you can replace the comment `// code` with your desired functionality, considering the provided parameters and their types. The `longest_with_an_announcement` function returns a string slice (`&'a str`), which is the same lifetime as the input parameters `x` and `y`. You can use the `ann` parameter, which is of type `T`, to perform any necessary actions that involve displaying its value (since it implements the `Display` trait).

Remember to import the necessary modules and handle any additional dependencies as required by your implementation.
