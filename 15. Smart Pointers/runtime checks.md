# runtime checks

Explain to me in details about runtime checks in Rust

___

In Rust, runtime checks refer to mechanisms that validate certain conditions or behaviors of a program during its execution. While Rust's strong static analysis catches many errors at compile time, some checks are deferred to runtime to ensure correctness and safety in situations that cannot be entirely determined statically. Rust employs runtime checks primarily in the following areas:

1. **Bounds Checking**: Rust ensures that array and vector accesses are within the valid range to prevent buffer overflows and out-of-bounds memory access. During runtime, array or vector accesses are checked against their declared size or length, and if an access is out of bounds, Rust will trigger a runtime panic. This helps prevent memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.

2. **Option and Result Handling**: Rust's `Option` and `Result` types are used to handle potentially absent or error-prone values respectively. When unwrapping an `Option` or `Result`, Rust performs a runtime check to determine if the value is present or if an error occurred. If the check fails, a runtime panic is triggered, providing detailed information about the error or absence of the value.

3. **Pattern Matching Exhaustiveness**: When using exhaustive pattern matching, Rust ensures that all possible cases are covered. If a match expression does not account for all potential values of the matched type, the Rust compiler will raise a compile-time error. However, in situations where the full set of cases cannot be determined statically, Rust performs a runtime check to verify that no unmatched cases are encountered during execution.

4. **Runtime Borrow Checking**: Rust enforces borrowing rules statically to prevent data races and invalid references. However, there are scenarios where runtime checks are necessary, such as dynamic dispatch or handling interior mutability. In these cases, Rust uses runtime borrow checks to ensure that borrows and mutable borrows are correctly managed, preventing multiple mutable borrows or invalid use of borrowed references.

5. **Custom Runtime Assertions**: Developers can use the `assert!` and `debug_assert!` macros to define custom runtime checks. These macros evaluate an expression and trigger a runtime panic if the expression evaluates to `false`. Custom assertions are useful for verifying invariants, enforcing preconditions or postconditions, and performing runtime debugging.

It's important to note that Rust encourages developers to handle errors gracefully and propagate them using the `Result` type rather than relying on runtime panics. Runtime checks should be used judiciously and for critical situations where it is not possible to perform the checks statically.

Overall, Rust's combination of static analysis and runtime checks provides a robust system for ensuring program correctness, preventing memory safety issues, and handling exceptional situations at runtime. By catching errors both statically and dynamically, Rust helps developers write more reliable and secure software.
