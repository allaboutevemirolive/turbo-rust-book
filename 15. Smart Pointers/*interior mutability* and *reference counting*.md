# *interior mutability* and *reference counting*

Give me example in rust about *interior mutability* and *reference counting*

___


Certainly! Here's an example in Rust that demonstrates both interior mutability and reference counting (RC).

Interior mutability allows you to mutate data even when you only have an immutable reference to it, by ensuring that the mutation adheres to certain runtime borrowing rules. This is useful in situations where you need to mutate data that is otherwise immutable, such as when sharing data between multiple owners.

Reference counting, on the other hand, is a technique that keeps track of the number of references pointing to a value. When the last reference goes out of scope, the value is deallocated. It allows multiple owners to share ownership of a value.

Let's say we want to create a program that maintains a counter and allows multiple threads to increment it concurrently. We can use `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) to create a shared reference-counted counter, and `Mutex` (Mutual Exclusion) to enable interior mutability and ensure thread safety.

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Create a reference-counted counter
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));

    let mut handles = vec![];

    // Spawn multiple threads to increment the counter
    for _ in 0..5 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            // Acquire a lock on the counter
            let mut value = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *value += 1; // Mutate the counter

            // Lock is automatically released when `value` goes out of scope
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Retrieve the final counter value
    let final_value = *counter.lock().unwrap();

    println!("Final counter value: {}", final_value);
}
```

In this example, we create an `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) around a `Mutex`, which wraps the counter value. The `Arc` ensures that the reference count is properly managed, allowing multiple threads to share ownership of the counter safely. Each thread acquires a lock on the `Mutex`, which provides interior mutability, and increments the counter by modifying the value inside the locked `Mutex`.

Finally, we retrieve the final counter value by acquiring the lock again and printing it to the console.
