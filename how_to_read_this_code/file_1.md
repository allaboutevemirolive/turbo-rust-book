How do I read this in Rust? 

```rust
fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str,
    ann: T,
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
// code
}
```

To read the given code in Rust, you can break it down and understand its components step by step:

1. Function Declaration:
   - The code begins with the declaration of a function named `longest_with_an_announcement`.
   - The function takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `ann`.
     - `x` and `y` are references to string slices (`&'a str`) that have a lifetime `'a`.
     - `ann` is a generic parameter of type `T`.
   
2. Trait Bound:
   - Following the parameter list, there is a `where` clause specifying a trait bound.
   - The bound specifies that the type `T` must implement the `Display` trait.
   
3. Function Body:
   - After the function declaration and trait bound, there is a function body denoted by the opening and closing curly braces.
   - The actual implementation of the function is missing in the provided code snippet, indicated by the comment `// code`.
   - You would need to fill in the function body with the desired logic.

To complete the implementation, you can replace the comment `// code` with your desired functionality, considering the provided parameters and their types. The `longest_with_an_announcement` function returns a string slice (`&'a str`), which is the same lifetime as the input parameters `x` and `y`. You can use the `ann` parameter, which is of type `T`, to perform any necessary actions that involve displaying its value (since it implements the `Display` trait).

Remember to import the necessary modules and handle any additional dependencies as required by your implementation.
