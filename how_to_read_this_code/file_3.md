How do I read this in Rust?

```rust
pub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {
    String::from("Hello!")
}
```



To read the provided code snippet in Rust:

1. Function Declaration:
   - The code begins with the declaration of a public function named `greeting`.
   - The function takes a parameter `name` of type `&str`, which is a reference to a string slice.
   - The function returns a `String` that represents a greeting.

2. Function Body:
   - The function body creates a new `String` using the `String::from` function.
   - The created string contains the literal "Hello!".

In this code, the `greeting` function always returns the same static greeting message of "Hello!" regardless of the value of the `name` parameter. If you want to include the `name` in the greeting, you would need to modify the function body accordingly, such as by using the `format!` macro to create a dynamic greeting.

To use this code, you can call the `greeting` function and provide a name as an argument. The function will always return the string "Hello!".
