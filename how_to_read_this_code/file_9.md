How do I read this code in Rust?

```rust
Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))
```


To read the provided code snippet in Rust:

The code `Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))` creates an `Err` variant of the `Result` enum. It represents a failed result with an associated error value. In this case, the error value is a `String` object created using the `String::from` function, with the error message "two plus two does not equal four".

The `Result` type is commonly used in Rust to handle operations that can produce either a successful result (`Ok`) or an error value (`Err`). By convention, the `Ok` variant is used to represent a successful outcome, and the `Err` variant is used to represent an error or failure condition.

In this code, the `Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))` expression is used to indicate that the operation or test has failed due to the condition described by the error message.
