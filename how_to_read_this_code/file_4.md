How do I read this in Rust?

```rust
    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting("Carol");
        assert!(
            result.contains("Carol"),
            "Greeting did not contain name, value was `{}`",
            result
        );
    }
```


To read the provided code snippet in Rust:

1. Test Function:
   - The code is within a test function named `greeting_contains_name`.
   - The `#[test]` attribute indicates that this is a unit test.
   - The test function is responsible for asserting that the greeting returned by the `greeting` function contains the provided name.

2. Function Call and Assertion:
   - The test function calls the `greeting` function with the argument "Carol" and assigns the result to the `result` variable.
   - The `assert!` macro is used to perform an assertion.
   - The first argument of `assert!` is an expression to evaluate for truthiness.
   - In this case, the expression is `result.contains("Carol")`, which checks if the `result` string contains the substring "Carol".
   - If the expression is false (the substring is not found), the test will fail.
   - The remaining arguments of `assert!` are optional and used for custom error messages. In this case, it specifies a custom error message that will be displayed if the assertion fails. It includes the value of the `result` string in the error message.

When running the test function, it ensures that the `greeting` function produces a greeting string that contains the provided name ("Carol"). If the name is not present in the greeting, the test will fail and display a custom error message indicating the value of the `result` string.

You can run the test by executing `cargo test` in the project directory to verify that the greeting contains the expected name.
