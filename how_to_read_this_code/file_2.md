How do I read this in Rust?

```rust
pub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello {}!", name)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting("Carol");
        assert!(result.contains("Carol"));
    }
}
```

To read the provided code snippet in Rust:

1. Function Declaration:
   - The code begins with the declaration of a public function named `greeting`.
   - The function takes a parameter `name` of type `&str`, which is a reference to a string slice.
   - The function returns a `String` that represents a formatted greeting.

2. Function Body:
   - The function body uses the `format!` macro to create a formatted string.
   - The formatted string includes the value of the `name` parameter, which is inserted using `{}` as a placeholder.
   - The exclamation mark `!` indicates that `format!` is a macro rather than a regular function call.

3. Test Module:
   - After the function declaration, there is a module declaration for tests indicated by `#[cfg(test)]`.
   - This module is only compiled and executed when running tests.
   - The `mod tests` statement declares a submodule named `tests` within the current module.
   - The `use super::*;` statement imports all items (functions, types, etc.) from the parent module.

4. Test Function:
   - Within the `tests` submodule, there is a test function named `greeting_contains_name`.
   - The `#[test]` attribute indicates that this is a unit test.
   - The test function calls the `greeting` function with the argument "Carol" and assigns the result to the `result` variable.
   - The `assert!` macro is used to check that the `result` string contains the substring "Carol".
   - If the assertion fails (the substring is not found), the test will fail.

To use this code, you can call the `greeting` function and provide a name as an argument. The function will return a formatted greeting string. Additionally, you can run the test function by executing `cargo test` in the project directory to verify that the greeting contains the expected name.
