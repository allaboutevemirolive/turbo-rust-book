How do I read this code in Rust?

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() -> Result<(), String> {
        if 2 + 2 == 4 {
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))
        }
    }
}
```


To read the provided code snippet in Rust:

1. Test Module:
   - The code begins with a module declaration for tests indicated by `#[cfg(test)]`.
   - This module is only compiled and executed when running tests.
   - The `mod tests` statement declares a submodule named `tests` within the current module.

2. Test Function:
   - Within the `tests` submodule, there is a test function named `it_works`.
   - The `#[test]` attribute indicates that this is a unit test.
   - The test function returns a value of type `Result<(), String>`, which means it either returns `Ok(())` to indicate a successful test or `Err(String)` to indicate a failed test.
   - Inside the test function, there is an if-else statement.
   - If the expression `2 + 2 == 4` evaluates to `true`, it returns `Ok(())` to indicate a successful test.
   - If the expression evaluates to `false`, it returns `Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))` to indicate a failed test with an error message.

In this code, the test function `it_works` verifies if the sum of 2 + 2 is equal to 4. If the sum is equal to 4, it returns `Ok(())` indicating a successful test. Otherwise, it returns `Err(String)` with an error message indicating that the sum is not equal to 4, indicating a failed test.

When running tests using `cargo test`, this test function will be executed, and if the assertion fails, it will display the provided error message.
