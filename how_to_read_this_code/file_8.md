How do I read this code in Rust?

```rust
fn it_works() -> Result<(), String> {
```


To read the provided code snippet in Rust:

1. Function Declaration:
   - The code declares a function named `it_works`.
   - The function has no parameters.
   - The return type of the function is `Result<(), String>`.
   - The `Result` type is an enum that represents either success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`).
   - The unit type `()` is used as the success value to indicate that the function succeeded without producing a meaningful result.
   - The `String` type is used as the error value to indicate an error condition along with an error message.

In this code, the `it_works` function represents a test function. It either returns `Ok(())` to indicate a successful test or `Err(String)` to indicate a failed test with an associated error message.

When running tests using `cargo test`, this test function will be executed, and the test framework will determine if the test succeeded or failed based on the returned value.
