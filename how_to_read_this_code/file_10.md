How do I read this code in Rust?

```rust
Result<T, E>
```


To read the provided code snippet in Rust:

The code `Result<T, E>` represents a generic type in Rust that is used to handle operations that can produce either a successful result (`Ok<T>`) or an error value (`Err<E>`). It is an enum that has two variants:

1. `Ok<T>`: Represents a successful outcome with a value of type `T`.
2. `Err<E>`: Represents an error or failure condition with a value of type `E`.

The `Result<T, E>` type is commonly used in Rust to handle operations that may fail, such as file I/O, network operations, or parsing. It provides a way to propagate and handle errors in a structured manner, without resorting to unchecked exceptions.

The `T` and `E` in `Result<T, E>` are generic type parameters that can be replaced with concrete types depending on the context. The `T` parameter represents the type of the value produced in case of success, while the `E` parameter represents the type of the error value produced in case of failure.

When a function returns a `Result<T, E>`, it indicates that the function can either produce a successful result of type `T` or an error value of type `E`. The caller of the function can then handle the result using pattern matching or other methods to determine the outcome and take appropriate actions.

In summary, `Result<T, E>` is a generic type in Rust used to handle operations that can result in success (`Ok<T>`) or failure (`Err<E>`), where `T` represents the success value type, and `E` represents the error value type.
