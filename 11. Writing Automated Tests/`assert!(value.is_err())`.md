Generate rust code with main function to demonstrate this code 

assert!(value.is_err())



Certainly! Here's an example of Rust code with a `main` function that demonstrates the usage of `assert!(value.is_err())`:

```rust
fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    if y == 0 {
        Err(String::from("Division by zero"))
    } else {
        Ok(x / y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10, 0);

    assert!(result.is_err());

    if let Err(err) = result {
        println!("Error: {}", err);
    }
}
```

In this code, the `divide` function takes two integers `x` and `y` as parameters and attempts to perform division. If `y` is zero, it returns an `Err` variant with the error message "Division by zero". Otherwise, it returns an `Ok` variant with the result of the division.

In the `main` function, we call `divide(10, 0)` to perform a division by zero, which results in an error. We then use `assert!(result.is_err())` to assert that the result is an error. If the result is indeed an error, the assertion passes. If the result is not an error, the assertion fails, and an error message is displayed.

Additionally, we use a `match` statement (`if let Err(err) = result`) to pattern match on the `Err` variant of the `result` and print the associated error message if it exists.

You can run this code by saving it to a `.rs` file, such as `main.rs`, and executing `cargo run` in the project directory.
