In Rust, a thread refers to a lightweight unit of execution that allows concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single program. Threads are used to achieve parallelism or to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

Rust provides a built-in threading library called `std::thread` that allows you to create and manage threads in your programs. With this library, you can create new threads, spawn them, and synchronize their execution using various synchronization primitives.

To create a new thread in Rust, you use the `thread::spawn` function, which takes a closure containing the code that will run in the new thread. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Creating a new thread
    let thread_handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        // Code to be executed in the new thread
        println!("Hello from the new thread!");
    });

    // Code in the main thread

    // Wait for the new thread to finish execution
    thread_handle.join().expect("Thread panicked!");
}
```

In the above example, the `thread::spawn` function creates a new thread and executes the code inside the closure in that thread. The `join` method is used to wait for the new thread to finish execution before continuing with the main thread.

Threads can communicate with each other using message passing or shared mutable state. Rust provides synchronization primitives such as `Mutex`, `Arc`, `Condvar`, and `Channel` for coordinating access to shared data between threads and preventing data races.

It's important to note that Rust's ownership and borrowing rules apply to threads as well. This ensures that [[data races]] and other [[concurrency-related bugs]] are caught at compile time, guaranteeing thread safety and memory safety in concurrent programs.
