# Mathematical Symbols in Markdown

This is an example of a markdown file that includes mathematical symbols.

## Inline Equations

You can use inline equations by enclosing the LaTeX code within dollar signs. Here are a few examples:

- The quadratic formula is given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
- Euler's identity is defined as $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

## Display Equations

To display equations on separate lines, you can use double dollar signs:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$

## Greek Letters

You can use Greek letters by using their corresponding LaTeX command. Here are a few examples:

- Alpha: $\alpha$
- Beta: $\beta$
- Gamma: $\gamma$
- Delta: $\delta$

## Fractions and Superscripts

Fractions can be represented using the `\frac` command, and superscripts using the `^` symbol:

- $\frac{1}{2}$
- $x^2$

## Other Symbols

There are many other mathematical symbols you can use, such as:

- Square root: $\sqrt{x}$
- Summation: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$
- Integral: $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$
- Pi: $\pi$

For a comprehensive list of LaTeX symbols, you can refer to the [LaTeX symbol guide](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols).

Let us explore the possible natural choices for parameterizations for instance $I=\left(\Sigma, X^{+}, X^{+}, t\right)$. 

We could look at $\kappa_1(I)=|\Sigma|, \kappa_2=\left|X^{+} \cup X^{-}\right|, \kappa_3(I)=$ $\max \left\{|w| \mid w \in X^{+} \cup X^{-}\right\}, \kappa_4(I)=t$, and there are quite a number of further ways to parameterize with respect to the sets $X^{+}$and $X^{-}$. 

The NP-hardness results (with different constructions) extend to situations when $\kappa_1(I)=2$ or when $\kappa_3(I)=2$ or when $\kappa_4(I)=2$. This immediately entails the following results.
