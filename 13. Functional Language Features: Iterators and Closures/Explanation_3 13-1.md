In rust what code use variable inside vertical bars ||

___

In Rust, closures with variables inside the vertical bars `||` are used to specify the arguments that the closure expects. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let closure = |name: &str| {
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    };

    closure("John");
}
```

In this example, the closure `closure` takes a single argument named `name`, which is of type `&str`. When the closure is invoked with `closure("John")`, the argument `"John"` is passed to the closure, and it prints `Hello, John!` to the console.

Using variables inside the vertical bars allows you to define the input parameters that the closure expects. These variables can have various types and are determined by the arguments you provide when invoking the closure.

Here's another example that demonstrates a closure with multiple arguments:

```rust
fn main() {
    let closure = |x: i32, y: i32| {
        println!("The sum of {} and {} is: {}", x, y, x + y);
    };

    closure(3, 4);
}
```

In this case, the closure `closure` takes two arguments of type `i32`, `x` and `y`. When the closure is invoked with `closure(3, 4)`, it prints `The sum of 3 and 4 is: 7` to the console.

Closures with variables inside the vertical bars allow you to define the argument list and the types of those arguments, providing flexibility in capturing and using variables when the closure is invoked.
