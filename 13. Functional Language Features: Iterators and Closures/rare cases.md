Explain to me the statement below and give me example for it 

"There are rare cases where the compiler needs closure type annotations too"

___

In most cases, the Rust compiler can infer the type of a closure based on its usage and the types of variables it captures or arguments it receives. However, there are rare situations where the compiler may require explicit type annotations for closures.

When the closure's type cannot be inferred unambiguously or when using the closure in a complex context, such as passing it as an argument to a higher-order function or when using it in a generic context, providing type annotations for the closure becomes necessary.

Here's an example to illustrate a situation where closure type annotations are required:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
```

In this example, we have a vector of numbers and we want to calculate their sum using the `fold` method on the iterator. The closure passed to `fold` takes two arguments: `acc` (the accumulator) and `x` (the current element being processed). The closure adds the current element to the accumulator.

However, if we try to compile this code without specifying the type of the `acc` variable in the closure explicitly, the compiler will raise an error:

```
error[E0282]: type annotations needed for `std::iter::Iterator::fold`
 --> src/main.rs:4:30
  |
4 |     let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);
  |                              ^^^ cannot infer type for `B`
  |
  = note: type must be known at this point
```

To resolve this error, we need to provide a type annotation for the `acc` variable in the closure:

[[Explain rare case]]

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc: i32, &x| acc + x);

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
```

By explicitly annotating the `acc` variable as `i32`, we inform the compiler about the type and resolve the error.

These situations where the compiler requires closure type annotations are relatively rare, as Rust's type inference is generally powerful and can deduce the types accurately. However, in complex scenarios or when type ambiguity arises, providing explicit type annotations for closures helps ensure the code is unambiguous and compiles successfully.
