Explain to me how this code works in details

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    thread::spawn(move || println!("From thread: {:?}", list))
        .join()
        .unwrap();
}
```

The provided code demonstrates the usage of closures and threading in Rust. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the code works:

1. Importing Required Modules: The code starts by importing the `thread` module from the standard library. This module provides functionality for creating and managing threads in Rust.

2. Variable Initialization: The `list` variable is initialized as a vector with the values `[1, 2, 3]`. This vector holds a collection of integers.

3. Printing the Initial State: The line `println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);` prints the current state of the `list` vector. This allows us to see its contents before the closure and thread execution.

4. Thread Creation and Closure Definition: The `thread::spawn()` function is called, which creates a new thread to execute a closure. The closure is defined using the `move` keyword, indicating that it captures ownership of variables from its enclosing scope.

5. Closure Body: The closure body is defined as `|| println!("From thread: {:?}", list)`. Inside the closure, the thread prints the contents of the `list` vector.

6. Thread Execution: The created thread starts executing the closure concurrently with the main thread. The closure's execution is independent of the main thread, allowing for parallelism.

7. Joining Threads: The `join()` method is called on the returned `JoinHandle` object, which waits for the thread to finish execution. This ensures that the main thread waits for the spawned thread to complete before continuing.

8. Error Handling: The `unwrap()` method is used to extract the result of the `join()` operation. If an error occurs during the thread execution, `unwrap()` will panic and display an error message.

Let's summarize the flow:

- The `list` vector is initialized and printed.
- A new thread is created using `thread::spawn()`, and a closure capturing the `list` vector is defined.
- The closure's body is executed concurrently in the new thread, printing the vector's contents.
- The main thread waits for the spawned thread to complete using `join()`.
- If the thread execution encounters any errors, they are unwrapped using `unwrap()`.

Note: The use of `move` in the closure is necessary because the closure captures ownership of the `list` vector. Since the closure runs in a separate thread, it needs to own the data it references to avoid potential issues with concurrent access.

By leveraging threads and closures, Rust allows for concurrent execution and takes advantage of multi-core processors, enabling efficient parallel programming.
