Give me a main function to use the the expensive closure

___


Certainly! Here's an example of a `main` function that uses the `expensive_closure`:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    };

    let result = expensive_closure(42);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

In this example, the `main` function includes the declaration and usage of the `expensive_closure`.

1. The `expensive_closure` is defined using the same closure syntax as before.

2. Inside the `main` function, the closure is invoked with an argument of `42` using `expensive_closure(42)`. This triggers the execution of the closure's body.

3. The closure's body includes the slow calculation simulation, which involves printing "calculating slowly..." to the console and pausing the execution for 2 seconds.

4. After the closure execution completes, the result of the closure is stored in the `result` variable.

5. Finally, the `println!` macro is used to print the value of `result` to the console.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
calculating slowly...
Result: 42
```

This demonstrates the usage of the expensive closure, where the closure's body is executed, simulating a time-consuming operation, and the result is obtained and printed.
