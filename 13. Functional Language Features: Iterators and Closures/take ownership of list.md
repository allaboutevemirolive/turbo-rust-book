What do you mean by "take ownership of list"?

In Rust, "taking ownership" refers to 

>transferring the ownership of a value from one owner to another. 

When a value is owned by a variable, that variable is responsible for its memory allocation, deallocation, and overall management. Only one owner can exist for a value at a given time.

In the provided code, the closure defined inside the `thread::spawn()` function captures the `list` variable from its enclosing scope. By using the `move` keyword before the closure definition (`move || ...`), the closure takes ownership of the `list` vector. 

>This means that the closure becomes the new owner of the vector, responsible for its lifetime and deallocation.

Taking ownership in this context ensures that the closure has exclusive access to the `list` vector. It allows the closure to use and manipulate the vector freely, without worrying about potential conflicts with other code that may also have a reference to the vector.

Once the closure takes ownership of the `list` vector, the original owner (in this case, the main thread) no longer has access to it. This transfer of ownership allows the closure to execute concurrently in a separate thread, independently of the main thread.

Taking ownership is a fundamental concept in Rust's ownership system, which helps prevent common issues like data races and memory leaks. It enforces strict rules for how values are passed and shared between different parts of a program, ensuring memory safety and thread-safety.
