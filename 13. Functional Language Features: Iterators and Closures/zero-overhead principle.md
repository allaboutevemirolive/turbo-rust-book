# zero-overhead principle

Explain to me the zero-overhead principle:

What you don’t use, you don’t pay for.

And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.

The "zero-overhead principle" is a fundamental concept in Rust that emphasizes the language's design philosophy of providing efficient abstractions and features. It can be summarized by two statements:

1. "What you don’t use, you don’t pay for": This means that if you choose not to use certain features or abstractions in Rust, you won't incur any unnecessary performance penalties or costs associated with those features. Rust allows developers to opt out of certain language features if they are not needed for their specific use case, ensuring that no unnecessary runtime overhead is introduced.

2. "What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better": This statement highlights Rust's ability to generate optimized machine code for the features and abstractions that are used. When you choose to use specific features in Rust, such as high-level abstractions or expressive language constructs, the Rust compiler is designed to generate code that is as efficient as if you had manually written it in a lower-level language like C or C++. Rust's zero-cost abstractions and compile-time analysis enable the generated code to be just as performant, if not better, than what could be achieved by manual optimization.

In essence, the zero-overhead principle in Rust ensures that developers have the flexibility to use only the features they need without incurring any unnecessary performance costs, while also guaranteeing that the features they do use are optimized to the best possible extent. This principle allows developers to write code that is both high-level and efficient, making Rust a powerful choice for performance-critical applications.
