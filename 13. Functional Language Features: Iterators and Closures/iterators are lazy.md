What does it in rust mean when we say "iterators are lazy"

___

In Rust, when we say "iterators are lazy," it means that iterators do not perform any computation or iteration until explicitly requested. They follow a lazy evaluation strategy, where the iteration logic is executed on-demand as elements are requested from the iterator.

Lazy evaluation provides efficiency benefits by avoiding unnecessary computations and memory allocations. It allows you to work with potentially large data sets without needing to load everything into memory at once. Instead, you can process the data incrementally, only loading and working with elements as needed.

Here's an example to illustrate the laziness of iterators:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let squared_numbers = numbers.iter().map(|&x| x * x);

    println!("Before calling collect()");

    // Iteration and mapping haven't happened yet

    for num in squared_numbers {
        println!("{}", num);
    }

    println!("After calling collect()");
}
```

In the example, `numbers.iter()` creates an iterator over the vector `numbers`, and `map(|&x| x * x)` applies a mapping operation to square each element. However, the actual iteration and mapping operations are not executed until we start consuming the iterator, which happens in the `for num in squared_numbers` loop.

Before the loop, the output will be:

```
Before calling collect()
```

The iteration and mapping operations are deferred until explicitly requested. Once we start consuming the iterator in the loop, the laziness ends, and the iteration and mapping are performed. Finally, the output will be:

```
1
4
9
16
25
After calling collect()
```

Lazy evaluation is a powerful concept in Rust because it allows you to build complex data processing pipelines using iterators without incurring unnecessary overhead. It enables efficient and flexible handling of large data streams or sequences.
