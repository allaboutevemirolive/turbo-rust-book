Explain to me how this code works in details 

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc: i32, &x| acc + x);

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
```

Sure! Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code begins with the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.

2. Inside the `main` function, a vector called `numbers` is created and initialized with the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. This vector contains a series of numbers.

3. The `iter()` method is called on the `numbers` vector, which returns an iterator over the elements of the vector.

4. The `fold` method is then called on the iterator. The `fold` method is a higher-order function that accumulates a value by applying a closure to each element of the iterator.

5. The `fold` method takes two arguments:
   - The initial value of the accumulator, which is `0` in this case.
   - A closure that defines how the accumulator is updated for each element. The closure takes two arguments: `acc` (the accumulator) and `x` (the current element of the iterator).

6. Inside the closure, the current element `x` is added to the accumulator `acc` using the `+` operator.

7. The return value of the `fold` method is assigned to the variable `sum`, and a type annotation `: i32` is provided to specify that the type of `sum` should be `i32`.

8. Finally, the `println!` macro is used to print the value of `sum` to the console. The `{}` placeholder inside the string is replaced with the value of `sum`.

In summary, this code calculates the sum of the numbers in the `numbers` vector using the `fold` method and a closure. The initial accumulator value is `0`, and for each element of the vector, the closure adds the element to the accumulator. The resulting sum is then printed to the console. In this specific case, the output would be `Sum: 15`, indicating that the sum of the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `15`.
