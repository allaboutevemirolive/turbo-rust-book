What is the thread in rust? 

Let's say I want to call list vector again outside the thread::spawn, should I invoke list variable or thread::spawn?

In Rust, a thread represents 

> an independent sequence of instructions that can execute concurrently with other threads within a program. 

It allows for parallel execution of code, enabling tasks to run simultaneously and take advantage of multi-core processors.

When you use `thread::spawn()` in Rust, you're creating a new thread separate from the main thread. This new thread executes the code provided in the closure passed to `thread::spawn()`. The closure is essentially a chunk of code that can be executed concurrently in the new thread.

In your example code, the `list` vector is defined outside the `thread::spawn()` call. If you want to access the `list` vector again outside the spawned thread, you can simply use the `list` variable itself. The `list` vector is not modified or moved within the spawned thread, so it remains accessible to the main thread.

Here's an example to illustrate accessing the `list` vector both inside and outside the `thread::spawn()` call:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("From thread: {:?}", list);
        // Additional operations on the list can be performed here if needed
    }).join().unwrap();

    println!("After thread execution: {:?}", list);
    // You can still access the list vector here
}
```

In this example, you can see that the `list` vector is accessed within the spawned thread, printing its content. After the thread execution completes, you can continue to access the `list` vector outside the `thread::spawn()` call and print its content again.

To summarize, you can call the `list` vector outside the `thread::spawn()` call using the `list` variable itself. The spawned thread's execution does not affect the accessibility of the `list` vector in the main thread.
