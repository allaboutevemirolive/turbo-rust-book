The statement you provided explains that because multiple immutable references to `list` can exist at the same time, the `list` variable is accessible from different parts of the code.

In this code, `list` is accessible in the following places:

- Before defining the closure: The initial `println!` statement displays the content of `list` before the closure is defined. At this point, no closures have been created yet, and `list` is accessible as it was initially defined.

- After the closure definition but before the closure is called: The second `println!` statement displays the content of `list` after the closure is defined but before it is called. The closure has captured a reference to `list`, but it has not been executed yet, so `list` is still accessible.

- After the closure is called: The third `println!` statement displays the content of `list` after the closure is called with `only_borrows()`. The closure accesses and prints the content of `list`, but it doesn't modify it. As a result, `list` remains accessible after the closure is called.

In summary, the statement emphasizes that in this code, the presence of multiple immutable references to `list` allows the variable to be accessed and remain accessible from different points in the code, including before defining the closure, after defining the closure but before calling it, and after calling the closure.
