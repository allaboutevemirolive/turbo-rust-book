# no additional runtime overhead

What does it mean "no additional runtime overhead" in Rust?

___

In the context of Rust, "no additional runtime overhead" refers to the language's ability to provide certain guarantees and features without imposing any performance penalties or costs during runtime execution.

Rust aims to provide high-performance code with low-level control similar to that of languages like C and C++, while also offering safety guarantees that prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races. To achieve this, Rust employs a combination of static analysis, ownership and borrowing rules, and a strict type system.

When Rust code is compiled, these safety guarantees are enforced by the compiler at compile-time rather than at runtime. This means that the generated binary code is free from additional runtime checks or overhead associated with safety features. In other words, Rust provides safety without sacrificing runtime performance.

By eliminating runtime overhead, Rust allows developers to write code that is both safe and efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
