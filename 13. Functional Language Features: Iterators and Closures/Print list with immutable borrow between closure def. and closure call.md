Sure! Here's the modified `main` function that attempts to print the content of `list` using an immutable borrow between the closure definition and the closure call:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    {
        let borrowed_immutable = &list;
        println!("Immutable borrow: {:?}", borrowed_immutable);
    }

    let mut borrows_mutably = || list.push(7);

    borrows_mutably();
    println!("After calling closure: {:?}", list);
}
```

In this code, I've added a new block `{}` within the `main` function. Inside this block, a new variable `borrowed_immutable` is defined using an immutable borrow `&list`. The content of `list` is printed using `println!` macro while holding an immutable reference.
