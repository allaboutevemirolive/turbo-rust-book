What is "*" in the code above? And explain to me in details about "*" in Rust

___

In the code example provided, the `*` symbol is the dereference operator in Rust. It is used to access the value pointed to by a reference.

In Rust, references are a way to refer to values without taking ownership of them. They allow you to borrow a value rather than move or copy it. References are denoted by the `&` symbol, and they can be either mutable (`&mut`) or immutable (`&`).

When you have a reference, you typically access the value it refers to using the dereference operator `*`. It allows you to "dereference" the reference and obtain access to the underlying value.

Here's a detailed explanation of the `*` operator in Rust:

1. Creating References: When you create a reference to a value, you use the `&` operator. For example, `&x` creates an immutable reference to the value of `x`, and `&mut x` creates a mutable reference to `x`.

2. Dereferencing References: When you have a reference, you can use the `*` operator to dereference it and access the underlying value. For example, `*reference` gives you access to the value that the reference points to.

3. Modifying the Referenced Value: When you have a mutable reference (`&mut`), you can modify the value it refers to by dereferencing it and assigning a new value. For example, `*reference = new_value` assigns `new_value` to the variable that the mutable reference refers to.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of the dereference operator:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    let reference = &x; // Immutable reference to x

    println!("Value of x: {}", *reference); // Dereference and print the value of x

    let mut y = 10;
    let mut reference_mut = &mut y; // Mutable reference to y

    *reference_mut += 5; // Dereference and modify the value of y

    println!("Value of y: {}", *reference_mut); // Dereference and print the value of y
}
```

In this code, we have two variables: `x` and `y`. We create an immutable reference `reference` to `x` and a mutable reference `reference_mut` to `y`. Using the dereference operator `*`, we access the values of `x` and `y` through their respective references and print them.

The line `*reference_mut += 5;` modifies the value of `y` by dereferencing the mutable reference `reference_mut` and adding `5` to the referenced value.

In summary, the `*` symbol is the dereference operator in Rust. It allows you to access the value pointed to by a reference. It is used to read or modify the referenced value depending on whether the reference is immutable or mutable. The `*` operator is an essential tool for working with references and managing borrowed values in Rust.
