Explain to me about the statement below. 

Why called it environment? 

Is not it suppose to capture initialized parameter before the closure? 

"closure captures the ... parameter from the environment"

The statement you mentioned is referring to closures in Rust and the concept of capturing variables from the environment. Let's break it down to understand its meaning:

In Rust, closures are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding environment. When a closure captures variables, it means that it retains a reference to those variables and can access them even after they have gone out of scope or the original function has returned.

The term "environment" in this context refers to the lexical scope in which the closure is defined. It includes all the variables and values that are in scope at the location where the closure is defined. The closure captures variables from this environment, allowing it to access and use them when executed later.

The captured variables can be used within the closure's body as if they were declared inside it. This allows closures to carry and retain state from the enclosing scope, making them powerful tools for encapsulating behavior and maintaining context.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of capturing variables from the environment:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let closure = || {
        println!("Captured variable: {}", x);
    };

    closure();
}
```

In this example, we have a closure `closure` that captures the variable `x` from its environment, which is the `main` function. The closure is defined using the `||` syntax and stored in the variable `closure`. Inside the closure's body, we can access the captured variable `x` and print its value.

When we invoke `closure()` at the end, the closure is executed, and it prints the value of the captured variable `x`, which is `5`.

The ability to capture variables from the environment allows closures to retain and manipulate state that would otherwise be out of scope. It provides a flexible and convenient way to create self-contained behavior that can access and modify variables from its surrounding scope.

It's worth noting that closures can capture variables by value or by reference, depending on the specific capture mode used (`move` or default). This affects how the captured variables are accessed and their lifetime within the closure.
