Explain to me how this code works in details 
[[13-2 Main function]]

```rust
    let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    };
```

Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code declares a variable `expensive_closure` using the `let` keyword. This variable is assigned a closure as its value.

2. The closure is defined using the `|num: u32| -> u32 { ... }` syntax. It takes an argument `num` of type `u32` and returns a value of type `u32`.

3. Inside the closure, the line `println!("calculating slowly...");` prints the message "calculating slowly..." to the console.

4. The next line `thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));` pauses the execution of the thread for 2 seconds using the `sleep` function from the `thread` module. This simulates a long-running computation or an expensive operation.

5. After the sleep, the value of `num` is returned as the result of the closure.

6. The closure is assigned to the variable `expensive_closure`.

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the concept of an expensive closure. An expensive closure represents a computation or operation that takes a significant amount of time to complete. In this case, the closure simulates this expensive operation by pausing the execution for 2 seconds.

By assigning the closure to the variable `expensive_closure`, you can store the closure and use it later in the code. When the closure is invoked or called, it will execute its body, including the slow calculation and the print statement.

It's worth noting that this code snippet on its own doesn't demonstrate the usage of the closure; it only defines the closure and its behavior. To actually invoke and use the closure, you would need additional code that calls `expensive_closure(num)` with an appropriate `num` value.
