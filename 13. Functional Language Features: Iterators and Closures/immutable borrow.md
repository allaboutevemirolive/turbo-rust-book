Explain to me immutable borrowing in Rust in detail and give me example.

___

In Rust, immutable borrowing refers to the ability to borrow a reference to a variable without allowing it to be modified. It allows you to temporarily access the borrowed value in a read-only manner, ensuring that no modifications are made to the borrowed value within the borrowing scope. Immutable borrowing is an important mechanism in Rust that enforces memory safety and prevents data races.

When you have an immutable reference to a variable, it means you can read the value it points to but cannot modify it. Multiple immutable references to the same variable can coexist within the same scope, allowing for concurrent read-only access without conflicts.

Here's an example to illustrate immutable borrowing in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 42;

    // Immutable borrowing
    let borrowed_immutable = &number;

    println!("Borrowed value: {}", borrowed_immutable);
    println!("Original value: {}", number);
}
```

In this code, we have a variable `number` assigned the value `42`. We then create an immutable reference `borrowed_immutable` using the `&` operator. This reference allows us to read the value of `number` but not modify it.

The line `println!("Borrowed value: {}", borrowed_immutable);` prints the value of `number` through the immutable reference `borrowed_immutable`, confirming that we can access the value without modifying it.

Finally, we print the value of `number` itself using `println!("Original value: {}", number);` to demonstrate that the original value remains unchanged.

Key points about immutable borrowing in Rust:

1. Multiple Immutable Borrows: You can have multiple immutable borrows to a variable within the same scope. This allows for concurrent read-only access to the same data.

2. Exclusive Access: Immutable borrows are compatible with other immutable borrows but not with mutable borrows. You cannot have an active mutable borrow while there are active immutable borrows to the same variable. This ensures that no conflicting modifications occur.

3. Ownership and Borrowing: Immutable borrowing is a way to temporarily share ownership of a value without transferring ownership. It allows you to read the value without taking full ownership of it.

4. Lifetime and Scope: Immutable references are subject to the rules of variable scope and lifetime. They must not outlive the borrowed variable.

Immutable borrowing in Rust allows for safe concurrent access to shared data, as long as there are no conflicting modifications. It enables multiple parts of a program to read data without the need for costly synchronization mechanisms or locks. The borrowing rules enforced by Rust's compiler ensure memory safety and prevent data races, making Rust a reliable choice for concurrent programming.
