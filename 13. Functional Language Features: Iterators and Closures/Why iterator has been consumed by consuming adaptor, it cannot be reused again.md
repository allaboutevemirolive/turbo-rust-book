Why rust implement, that iterator that has been consumed by a consuming adaptor, it cannot be reused or iterated over again?

___

Rust's design choice to prevent reusing or iterating over an iterator that has been consumed by a consuming adaptor is primarily driven by two key factors: memory safety and clarity of code semantics.

1. Memory Safety: Rust aims to ensure memory safety by enforcing clear ownership and borrowing rules. When an iterator is consumed by a consuming adaptor, it means that the elements of the iterator have been moved or consumed, and their ownership has been transferred to the consuming adaptor. Allowing reuse or iteration over a consumed iterator could lead to potential memory safety issues, such as accessing moved or invalid data.

   By disallowing reuse of a consumed iterator, Rust helps prevent common bugs like use-after-move, use-after-free, or accessing dangling references. It guarantees that the code operates on valid, owned data and reduces the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities.

2. Clarity of Code Semantics: Rust aims to provide clear and predictable semantics for its APIs. By disallowing the reuse or iteration of a consumed iterator, the language maintains a clear distinction between consumed and unconsumed iterators. This clarity enhances code readability and avoids potential confusion or unexpected behavior.

   Consuming adaptors indicate a specific intent: consuming and processing elements of an iterator. Preventing reuse or iteration of a consumed iterator makes the code's behavior explicit and avoids accidental misuse or confusion about the state of the iterator.

It's worth noting that Rust provides other methods and adaptors that allow you to perform additional operations on an iterator without consuming it. These methods, such as `clone`, `peek`, or `by_ref`, enable you to work with iterators while retaining their ability to produce elements for future use or iteration.

By enforcing the restriction on reusing consumed iterators, Rust promotes a safe and predictable programming model, helping developers write code that is easier to reason about, less error-prone, and more maintainable.
